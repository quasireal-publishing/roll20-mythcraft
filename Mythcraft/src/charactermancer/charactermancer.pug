            p Welcome to the Mythcraft Charactermancer! This tool will guide you the steps by which you create a hero for your MythCraft game. Character creation involves both thinking about your backstory and your place in the world, and choosing what mechanical abilities you have.As you pick your character’s abilities, think about how that fits in with their personality and backstory. Designing your character’s mechanics involves six steps:
