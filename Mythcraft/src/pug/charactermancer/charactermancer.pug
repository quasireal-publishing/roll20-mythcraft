            p Welcome to the Mythcraft Charactermancer! This tool will guide you the steps by which you create a hero for your MythCraft game. Character creation involves both thinking about your backstory and your place in the world, and choosing what mechanical abilities you have.

            p As you pick your character’s abilities, think about how that fits in with their personality and backstory. Designing your character’s mechanics involves six steps:

            ol.list-decimal.list-inside
                li Choose a Lineage
                li Assign Attribute Points
                li Note your Stats
                li Determine your Background
                li Pick a Profession
                li Take a Starting Talent

charmancer.sheet-charmancer-lineage
    +slideTemplate("Lineage")
        p First, what is your character’s lineage? Pick from well-known fantasy lineages like dwarf or elf, or play a unique lineage like a squirrelly kleppin or a biotechnical raedeen. 
        p Each lineage allows you to make a choice when you first create your character, as no lineage is a monolith. You will either pick a sublineage, or you will pick from a list of lineage abilities to make yourself unique. Some lineage options give you Skill Points.

                    //- each val in lineages
                    //-     option(value=`${val}` data-i18n=val)

charmancer.sheet-charmancer-attributes
    +slideTemplate("Attributes")
        p Your character has six core attributes that define their physical and mental capabilities. You have a pool of points to distribute among these attributes, with certain minimums and maximums based on your chosen lineage.

charmancer.sheet-charmancer-stats
    +slideTemplate("Stats")
        p Your character has several stats that represent their health, energy, and other vital measures. These stats are influenced by your attributes and lineage.        

charmancer.sheet-charmancer-background
    +slideTemplate("Background")
        p Your character’s background reflects their history and experiences before the start of the game. Choose a background that fits your character’s story and provides useful skills or resources.

charmancer.sheet-charmancer-profession
    +slideTemplate("Profession")
        p Your character’s profession defines their role in the world and the skills they bring to the table. Choose a profession that complements your background and attributes.

charmancer.sheet-charmancer-talent
    +slideTemplate("Talent")
        p Finally, select a starting talent for your character. Talents are special abilities or powers that give your character unique advantages. Choose one that fits your character’s concept and enhances their capabilities.
