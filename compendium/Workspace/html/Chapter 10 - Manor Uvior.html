<p>
  This chapter contains a ready to run adventure that you can play through with
  your friends. Its basic design, with elements of combat, exploration, and
  social encounters, can serve as a basic guide when you design your own
  stories.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  This adventure has enough structure that you can run it without changing it,
  but it is also left open-ended enough that you can experiment with any of the
  tools mentioned throughout this book to customize it. For example, neither
  Uvior nor Mogg have explicit beliefs or quirks, but you are encouraged to add
  these to their personalities based on how you interpret their actions and
  based on what you believe would make for an interesting interaction at your
  table.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2>
<p>
  This adventure is designed for level 2 heroes, who will level up one time in
  the story. You can make your own heroes or use any of the characters from the
  Legends of MythCraft.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p>
  A beleaguered party seeks shelter from the storm in an abandoned manor
  overflowing with old books. As they explore, they will encounter roving
  undead, enchanted tomes, unexpected traps, and a band of hopeful gretchlings
  led by their elder, Mogg. The undead are the former hirelings of a
  once-powerful wizard named Uvior, who has now been reduced to a mere specter…
  literally. The gretchlings have invaded the manor in hopes of finding and
  devouring innumerable delicious magical scrolls.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  While the gretchlings are technically the manor’s invaders, Uvior was known to
  be a cruel and callous figure, so the heroes might find either side
  sympathetic. Ultimately, the heroes can defeat both the undead and the
  gretchlings, or they can side with one faction or the other to put an end to
  the manor’s conflict. Either way, they will be rewarded handsomely with jewels
  and magic items.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>ADVENTURE FLOW</b></h2>
<p>
  The adventurers can explore the manor freely. It can be helpful to think of
  the adventure in three parts:
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  1. The heroes explore the manor, learning a little about who lived here and
  what might live here now.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  2. The heroes will encounter undead and gretchlings. They might make an
  alliance with either side, or with neither side.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  3. The heroes will face off against the leader of the opposing faction. Or, if
  they made no alliances, then they might end up confronting both leaders
  separately. It is also possible to broker a peace between the two leaders,
  though having enough leverage to reasonably arrange a peace between Uvior and
  Mogg is very difficult and unlikely.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>RANDOM ENCOUNTERS</b></h2>
<p>
  When the pace drags, or when you want to apply pressure to the heroes, then
  you can roll or choose a random encounter on the table.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Additionally, when the party attempts to rest, they run a greater risk of a
  random encounter. If they Catch their Breath, then there is not an encounter.
  If they attempt to Recoup, roll 2d6. On a total of 5-9, there is no random
  encounter; on any other total, roll or choose a random encounter from the
  table. If they attempt to Take a Rest, make the roll as though they were
  recouping once for every 2 hours of the Rest (4 total rolls).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The exception is if they are in the chapel or have made an alliance with the
  undead or the gretchlings. If they have made an alliance with the undead, then
  they can Recoup or Take a Rest without rolling for random encounters if they
  are in the master bedroom. If they have made an alliance with the gretchlings,
  then they can Recoup or Take a Rest without rolling for random encounters if
  they are in the scriptorium. The first time that they Recoup or Take a Rest in
  the chapel, they also do not need to roll for random encounters.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>UVIOR APPEARS!</b></h2>
<p>
<em>The ghostly visage of a haggard, elderly human man in an embroidered maroon
    robe floats towards you.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Uvior is a cold, calculating, and cruel person, but will present himself as a
  gentleman. When speaking with people whom he might need a favor from, he is
  eloquent, courteous, and has the practiced false smile of a noble.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Uvior will be hostile to the party when they first meet, but will not be
  violent unless the party attacks. He will demand to know why they have invaded
  his home, “just like the others,” and will insist that they leave.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The party might ask him who else has invaded the home, or if they have met the
  gretchlings then they might infer who Uvior is speaking of. If they do pursue
  this line of questioning, then Uvior will begrudgingly make an alliance with
  them: they can take a small portion of treasure from his manor if they dispose
  of the gretchling infestation.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The amount of treasure that Uvior will part with depends on how high the party
  rolls on attribute checks. Each party member may make a CHA check (using a
  skill with the influence tag if they have one). Take the average of the
  party’s rolls.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>UVIOR’S TRAGEDY</b></h2>
<p>
  If the party asks Uvior about what happened before they arrived, Uvior is
  generally elusive, declaring that they need not concern themselves with the
  past and should just focus on getting rid of the gretchlings. A DC 12
  AWR/Intuiting check will confirm that he is hiding something, and a DC 24
  CHA/Persuading check will get Uvior to open up and explain what happened.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Six years ago, Uvior invited all of his old adventuring companions to have a
  feast with him in remembrance of their past quests. Uvior was particularly
  excited to show them an artifact he had discovered. When used correctly, the
  artifact would solidify the user’s soul into a physical form, effectively
  bestowing immortality upon the creature. However, the artifact malfunctioned,
  turning Uvior into some kind of ghost and exploding outward with concussive
  arcane force that immediately turned all of Uvior’s guests into stone. Uvior
  has been trapped in his incorporeal form ever since, and wants more than
  anything to discover a way to reverse the damage.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>FIGHTING UVIOR</b></h2>
<p>
  If the party threatens Uvior instead of talking with him, or if they try to
  abscond with more treasure than they agreed upon, it will result in combat.
  See the Showdown section for more information.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>UNDEAD HORDE</b></h2>
<p>
<em>Muffled footfalls and the rattle of metal give you a moment’s notice, and a
    horde of armed skeletons burst into view.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  2d4+2 <b>Skeletons </b>appear. If the party are allied with Uvior and have
  agreed to dispose of the gretchlings, then these skeletons do nothing
  threatening and move on. If the party has not yet met Uvior, then the
  skeletons will nonverbally communicate that the heroes should leave by
  rattling their weapons and pointing at the nearest exit. If the heroes try to
  speak or negotiate with the skeletons, then the skeletons will beckon for the
  heroes to follow and will take the heroes to the master bedroom (on the third
  floor), where they meet Uvior.
</p>
<br/>
<p>If the party fights the skeletons, the skeletons will fight until dead.</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>UNDEAD GUARDS</b></h2>
<p>
  This encounter is functionally the same as the Undead Horde encounter, but
  with 1d4+1 <b>Skeletons </b>instead.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>CREPITS</b></h2>
<p>
<em>The curtains rustle, and something scrapes and scrabbles out from under the
    furniture. Severed, skeletal limbs writhe towards you!</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  2d4 <b>Crepits </b>crawl out from under furniture, behind curtains, and the
  like. They will attack the heroes and will fight until dead.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>PORTRAIT TRAP</b></h2>
<p><em>You hear a quick, punctuated hiss.</em></p>
<br/>
<p>
  Randomly determine one of the party members and make a +3 attack against their
  ANT. On a hit, that creature is struck by a poison dart that shot forth from a
  wall portrait. Roll on the following table to determine its effect.
</p>
<br/>

</table>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>NO ENCOUNTER</b></h2>
<p>
<em>Whatever you thought you heard, apparently it was nothing after all. The
    house was just settling, I suppose.</em>
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>FLOORBOARD TRAP</b></h2>
<p>
<em>You step on a floorboard that lets out a sharp creak.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Randomly determine one of the party members and make a +2 attack against their
  ANT. On a hit, a floorboard snaps. Their leg becomes stuck and they are
  Restrained (escape DC 12); the floorboard flies up and smacks them in the face
  for 1d4 blunt damage. The undead hear the commotion and 1d4
  <b>Skeletons</b> come to investigate.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>BOOK TRAP</b></h2>
<p>
  Do not use this trap too frequently; every four or five times a hero tries to
  interact with a book is plenty. When a hero grabs a book off of a shelf
  without first investigating (AWR/Investigating DC 14), the book might be
  trapped. Make a +4 attack against their ANT. On a hit, the shelf falls on the
  hero for 1d10 blunt damage, and the hero is Dazed for the next 1 minute.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>GRETCHLING SCOUTS</b></h2>
<p>
<em>You hear a faint rustling, and a wet footstep, but you see nothing at first
    glance.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  1d4+1 <b>Gretchlings </b>stealthily watch the heroes. The heroes can make
  AWR/Perceiving checks against DC 15 to spot the gretchlings.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the gretchlings can tell that the heroes have not yet spoken with Uvior
  (perhaps they just killed some skeletons), then one of the gretchlings will
  reveal herself to the party. Her name is Gooth, and she explains that the
  wizard who once lived here was a very evil man. Gooth uses a lot of
  superlative language and usually says someone’s name along with an epithet
  that she makes up on the fly.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  She and the other gretchlings, under the leadership of Mogg the Marvelous, are
  trying to find and devour all of his delicious magic scrolls and items. If the
  heroes will come back and meet Mogg, then Gooth is certain that they can work
  out some kind of deal. Maybe the heroes can defeat Uvior the Horrible in
  exchange for a couple magic items.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>FIGHTING THE GRETCHLINGS</b></h2>
<p>
  Gretchlings are not strong creatures, and they will flee if the heroes act
  violent. If this happens, they will return in force later, led by Mogg.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>GRETCHLING SQUAD</b></h2>
<p>
<em>You hear a chorus of slimy footsteps and quiet croaking. Large, reflective
    eyes stare out from the darkness.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  2d4+2 <b>Gretchlings </b>appear. If the party has already made an alliance
  with Mogg, then they are amicable towards the party and pass through quickly.
  If the party has not yet made an alliance with the gretchlings, then the
  gretchling squad’s leader, Begh, will confront the heroes.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Begh is very stern and militaristic, which has the unintended consequence of
  being amusing given how small and harmless a gretchling looks.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Begh tries to bully the heroes into leaving the manor, but if that does not
  work, then he will demand that they become his prisoners and he will escort
  them to Mogg.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>FIGHTING THE GRETCHLINGS</b></h2>
<p>
  Gretchlings are not strong creatures, and they will flee if the heroes act
  violent. If this happens, they will return in force later, led by Mogg.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MOGG APPEARS</b></h2>
<p>
<em>A speckled gretchling approaches you, holding a high, proud posture. He
    wears a wizard’s hat atop his amphibian head.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Mogg is a verbose gretchling that often misuses long words in an attempt to
  sound smarter. He cares for his fellow gretchlings and clearly commands their
  admiration.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Mogg will be hostile to the party when they first meet, but will not be
  violent unless the party attacks. He might comment in surprise that “some of
  Uvior’s servants are still living!”
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The party might ask him who Uvior is, or if they have met the skeletons then
  they might infer that Mogg is talking about the master of the house. If they
  do, Mogg is likely to ally with them: if they can defeat Uvior and make the
  manor safe for the gretchlings, then the gretchlings will let the heroes have
  any amount of gold they might find.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the party presses to negotiate, then choose one hero to make their case.
  That hero can roll a CHA/Persuading check, with the following outcomes.
</p>
<br/>

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>FIGHTING MOGG</b></h2>
<p>
  If the party threatens Mogg, it will result in combat. See the Showdown
  section for more information.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>THE MANOR</b></h2>
<p>
<em>Against the dark sky, a still darker manor looms. Its buttressed stone
    walls have a gown of ivy, thickest around the ground and much thinner
    nearing the rooftops. A crenelated balcony keeps silent vigil over the grand
    double doors, though it appears that no guards are present.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The manor is divided into four floors. This section contains maps and detailed
  information about what the heroes might find in each room. Note that on each
  map, arrows next to staircases point in the direction the stairs ascend.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Throughout the manor, the walls are decorated with scores of oil paintings of
  mediocre quality. There are wall sconces holding unlit candelabras, and the
  manor’s interior is completely dark unless otherwise noted in a specific room
  or unless the heroes produce a light source. Additionally, there are dozens of
  stacks of books dotting the halls. Books can also be found on virtually any
  flat surface, such as tables, countertops, and chairs.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The books range widely in topic. The books contain no pertinent information to
  the adventure unless otherwise noted in a specific room (such as the library
  or private study). However, if a hero wants to find a book that covers a topic
  of personal interest, they can make an DC 14 AWR/Investigating check. If
  successful, they find a book covering topics that they are interested in. As
  relevant, you might choose to award that hero a +1 in a skill with the
  knowledge tag while they have that book in their possession. A hero can make
  this check once in each room and once in the hallways of each floor.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>CLIMBING THE MANOR</b></h2>
<p>
  Heroes might try climbing the manor’s exterior. Doing so requires a
  STR/Athletics check. The DC is 12 to reach the crenelated balcony, and 18 to
  reach the rooftops. If the heroes have climbing gear, they do not need to make
  a STR/ Athletics check when climbing only to the balcony, and the climb to the
  rooftops becomes DC 13.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>WOLF PACKS AND WEATHER</b></h2>
<p>
  If the heroes try to venture back out of the manor, you have two options. You
  may let them ignore this adventure and do something else instead, or you can
  use wolves and harsh weather to encourage them to remain within the manor.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If you use the second approach and they venture back into the forest, use
  <b>Wolves</b>, <b>Dire Wolves</b>, and <b>Alpha Wolves</b> to threaten them
  with difficult encounters. A raging thunderstorm also makes the woods
  inhospitable and makes Taking a Rest much more difficult, as the heroes will
  need to succeed a DC 20 AWR/Sheltering check to find a cave that suitably
  shields them from the elements. This cave likely has more wolves in it,
  unfortunately.
</p>
<br/>
<img data-filename="Uvior_Manor_1_Detail" src="https://files.d20.io/images/475971195/J4rMXL8TVe7296Q_AeyKWA/original.jpg?1771164416"/>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>GROUND FLOOR</b></h2>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>1. DINING ROOM</b></h2>
<p>
  The dining room has several long tables with tasteful red table runners, unlit
  candelabras, and silver sets of cutlery and dining ware. Each seat at every
  table is set as though a grand feast was about to occur. At the head of the
  largest table, a steak knife has been slammed into the wood.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The heroes might naturally infer that this means the manor’s owner had a
  violent temper, or you can ask them to make AWR/Intuiting or AWR/Investigating
  checks at a DC of 12 to reach this conclusion.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  There are 2d4 <b>Skeletons</b> in the dining room, and they will act as they
  would in the Undead Horde random encounter. If a hero makes a LUCK/Scavenging
  check, they can find a number of unspoiled rations equal to ¼ their roll.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The total value of the silver in the room is 2,000 sc, but carrying so much
  wrought silver requires multiple carts. The heroes could carry 100 sc worth of
  these items before it would be considered unwieldy.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The dining room has a side doorway that opens into the courtyard.</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>2. KITCHEN</b></h2>
<p>
  The kitchen is dusty and dank, clearly having been neglected for some years.
  The wooden cabinets have warped with water damage and are overgrown with mold.
  A rickety staircase descends into what is likely a food cellar.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  1d4+1 <b>Skeletons </b>are in the kitchen, and they will act as they would in
  the Undead Horde random encounter.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The kitchen has 2d6 knives (which have the stats of knives or daggers, at your
  discretion).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If a hero makes a LUCK/Scavenging check, they can find a number of unspoiled
  rations equal to ½ their roll.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>3. BALLROOM</b></h2>
<p>
  The ballroom has circular wooden tables covered in white tablecloths. Tall
  stacks of books are on most tables and chairs, and even the floor in some
  parts of the room. They are arranged around a central dance floor: the floor’s
  wood is polished and patterned. A huge crystal chandelier hangs from the
  ceiling high above.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The ballroom is unoccupied and dusty.</p>
<br/>
<p>
  A balcony overlooks the ballroom, and although there are no stairs or ladders
  directly up to the balcony, heroes with rope or magic might be able to reach
  the balcony directly.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>4. COURTYARD</b></h2>
<p>
  The courtyard looks like it used to be well-curated, but it has since become
  wildly overgrown. The cobblestones are cracked and weeds poke up between them.
  A gazebo in the middle of the courtyard has been covered in ivy and kudzu. If
  the heroes get too close to any of the overgrown gardens, they will find that
  <b>Bloodoak Brambles </b>have taken root there and attack them when they can
  reach the heroes.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  A <b>Parsor </b>lives in the courtyard. While parsors are typically
  mischievous and playful, this one has been corrupted by Uvior’s vile presence.
  The parsor has a nasty disposition and will play cruel pranks on the heroes,
  but will not attack them directly unless the heroes strike first. If the
  heroes attack the parsor, then its <b>Martor</b> springs to its defense.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>5. FOYER</b></h2>
<p>
  The foyer is lavishly decorated to receive guests. Once-plush couches now sag
  under their own weight. Fireplaces lay dormant on the east and west walls, and
  grand staircases sweep up to an interior balcony in the heart of the second
  floor. Directly opposite the main entry, double doors open into the private
  courtyard. Smaller doorways open into narrow halls that flow into the east and
  west wings.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The foyer is carpeted, and the halls have rugs spaced periodically throughout.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  There is nothing of interest in the foyer, but if a hero makes a
  LUCK/Scavenging check, they can find sc equal to their roll as they look along
  the room’s ornamentation and through the couch stuffing.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>6. COAT CHECK</b></h2>
<p>The coat check is a small, unremarkable room that smells of mothballs.</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>7. LATRINE</b></h2>
<p>
  The latrine smells old and musty. A hero that makes a DC 10 AWR/Tracking check
  or AWR/Investigating check can determine that the latrine has not been used
  for several years.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>8. LIBRARY</b></h2>
<p>
  The library is a tremendous, three-floor room that takes up half of the east
  wing. The first floor has dozens of freestanding bookshelves in the middle of
  the room, and the walls on all three floors are lined with shelves as well.
  The second and third floors have balustraded balconies, allowing anyone on
  those floors to see down to the first floor.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Heroes can find books of any mundane topic within this library. They can also
  find a handful of spell scrolls. Any creature with such a spell scroll can
  cast the spell one time without using any SP. They must still spend the
  requisite AP to cast the spell. The power of the spell scroll that a hero
  finds depends on their INT/History or INT/Arcana roll.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Each hero can find one such scroll per hour spent in the library.</p>

<p>
  The northeast wall of the first floor also has a hidden doorway. A hero can
  spot this with a DC 16 AWR/Investigating check. By pulling on a book that is
  in fact a lever, a panel of shelving will swing open, revealing a staircase
  down to the scriptorium.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes are allied with the gretchlings, then the gretchlings will
  reveal this hidden doorway to them. At the end of each hour spent in the
  library, roll for a random encounter.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>9. CHAPEL</b></h2>
<p>
<em>The chapel is filled with rows of rotten pews, some of which have mostly
    collapsed into sawdust. If you look carefully, you see the off-white forms
    of termites crawling in the rotten wood. At the north end of the chapel,
    there is a simple pulpit from which a speaker might deliver a sermon. Glass
    double doors offer a clear view of the courtyard. Across from these doors,
    on the eastern side of the chapel, there is a small desk with a clay mug on
    it. The mug is glowing.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Any creatures with the undead tag in the chapel suffer the Sickened condition
  until they leave.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The clay mug has an imprint of an executioner’s axe. A hero that makes a DC 10
  INT/Religion (celestials) check knows that this is the mark of Rasheen, the
  daughter of Tovare. Rasheen prowls the planes and battles any creatures or
  entities that might threaten the cosmic balance.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  A hero that casts any spells to learn more about the mug, such as Sense Magic,
  can learn that it is under the effects of divine magic and the evoking
  function. If the hero’s ability allows them to learn the exact magical effect,
  they learn that the mug has been permanently affected by the Candle of Faith
  prayer.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Aside from the mug, there is nothing remarkable in the chapel. A narrow
  staircase leads up to the chapel’s balcony, part of the second floor. The
  chapel’s glass doors lead out into the courtyard.
</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>SECOND FLOOR</b></h2>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>1. GUEST BEDROOMS</b></h2>
<p>
  All of the guest bedrooms are similarly furnished: a single bed, a wardrobe,
  and a small writing desk. All are musty, and moths flick in and out of view.
  Most of the bedchambers show signs of having been used, such as the blankets
  being rumpled and shoved to one side, but even so, everything is covered in a
  layer of dust that would suggest years of disuse.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  One of the bedrooms contains a spellbook written in a cryptic cipher. A hero
  that makes a DC 20 INT/Arcana check can decipher it, learning that this
  spellbook once belonged to a halfling named Wick. Once the spellbook is
  deciphered, the creature that deciphered it can cast each of the following
  spells once, spending the correct amount of SP each time: Circle of Warding,
  Conceal Spell, Energy Siphon, Fly, Frost Beam, Grounded, Locate Magic, Minor
  Illusion, and Sense Magic.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>2. BALLROOM (BALCONY)</b></h2>
<p>
  The ballroom balcony overlooks the ballroom dance floor. It has circular
  tables covered in tablecloths, like those on the ground floor of the ballroom.
  They are also covered in stacks of books.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  It is possible for the heroes to find books of great relevance in this room.
  If they search for books and succeed on a DC 12 AWR/Investigating check, the
  heroes can find a diary penned by Sir Nikolai Zaffroni. Reading through his
  diary, they can learn the following information:
</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
    Nikolai was visiting Uvior along with a great many adventurers of middling
    import. Uvior made connections with many adventurers, including Nikolai, in
    his youth.
  </li>
<li>
    Uvior was known to only stay with an adventuring party when it benefitted
    him directly, especially when he got a large share of magical treasure.
  </li>
<li>
    Nikolai did not like Uvior and described him as an insufferable snot, but
    nonetheless it seems that Nikolai respected Uvior’s skill with arcane magic.
  </li>
<li>
    Nikolai’s primary adventuring party included a halfling mage named Wick and
    a human cleric of Rasheen named Humphrey.
  </li>
<li>
    Nikolai and the other adventurers that responded to Uvior’s summons came
    unsure what to expect, but they found that Uvior had prepared a grand
    banquet for them.
  </li>
<li>
    Nikolai’s last diary entry describes his confusion at the whole ordeal,
    given that Uvior was never one for shows of generosity.
  </li>
<li>The last diary entry is dated to just over six years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are no stairs or ladders down to the ground floor, but heroes that affix
  rope to the balustrade could climb down. Jumping down without aid results in
  1d4 falling damage, but a hero that makes a DC 16 DEX/Tumbling check can
  ignore this damage.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>3. FOYER (BALCONY)</b></h2>
<p>
  The second floor foyer is separated by an empty space looking down on the
  first floor. On both the north and south side of the foyer, hallways lead
  deeper into the east and west wings. On the south side of the foyer, a wide
  staircase leads up to the third floor, and doorways open out to a balcony
  overlooking the manor’s main entrance.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>4. CRENELATED BALCONY</b></h2>
<p>
  The crenelated balcony has empty quivers mounted on the insides of the crenels
  so that archers can easily stock up on arrows and quickly fire on enemies
  below. There is otherwise nothing of interest on this balcony.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>5. LIBRARY (BALCONY)</b></h2>
<p>
  The second floor of the library is functionally the same as the first floor,
  though without a hidden doorway. It connects to the second floor of the foyer,
  is across the hall from the chapel’s balcony, and has staircases to both the
  first and third floor of the library.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>6. CHAPEL (BALCONY)</b></h2>
<p>
  The chapel’s balcony overlooks the auditorium, and the glowing mug described
  in the ground floor’s chapel section is visible from the balcony. It has the
  keys to the pipe organ, which is badly out of tune. If the heroes play the
  pipe organ, it immediately triggers the Undead Horde encounter as
  <b>Skeletons</b> come to investigate. (Note that creatures with the undead tag
  are Sickened in the chapel balcony, as in the main chapel.)
</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>THIRD FLOOR</b></h2>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>1. CRENELATED BALCONY</b></h2>
<p>
  The crenelated balcony has empty quivers mounted on the insides of the crenels
  so that archers can easily stock up on arrows and quickly fire on enemies
  below. There is otherwise nothing of interest on this balcony.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  These balconies are occupied by 1d4 <b>Skeletons</b> each, who behave as
  described in the Undead Horde encounter.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>2. PRIVATE DINING</b></h2>
<p>
  The private dining room has a rectangular table that can seat eight people.
  The table is unladen aside from a few books written in a strange cipher.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  A DC 16 INT/Arcana check will allow a hero to decipher the text, which are
  extensive notes that Uvior had taken in an effort to learn how to cast a
  tremendous unique spell using an artifact that he found. It seems that if the
  spell went according to plan, his Essence would become corporeal and he would
  never again have to worry about sickness or poison, and he would cease to age.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The room is otherwise empty.</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>3. PRIVATE STUDY</b></h2>
<p>
  The private study is locked, but this can be overcome with a DC 16
  INT/Lockpicking or STR/Applied Force check.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<em>Old desks line every wall of this study. Parchment diagrams have been
    tacked to the walls and scattered across the floors, and a central table in
    the middle of the room displays a strange artifact. It looks like a blooming
    flower the size of a human torso, but is made of a strange black metal
    crisscrossed with glowing blue wires.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes study the notes strewn about the desk, walls, and floor they can
  discern that the flowerlike object on the table is some kind of powerful
  artifact that malfunctioned. A DC 12 INT/Arcana check allows a hero to
  determine that the artifact has lost all of its power. Nonetheless, the
  strange material is valuable, and the artifact will fetch 8,000 sc. It is
  unwieldy.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If they ask Uvior about this, he will begrudgingly tell the heroes his story
  (see the Uvior Appears! encounter).
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>4. MASTER BEDROOM</b></h2>
<p>
<em>Dominated by a large central bed with a torn canopy, the master bedroom
    also contains multiple ornate wardrobes, a large writing desk, and a gilded
    washbasin. Several skeletons stand guard around a ghostly, incorporeal
    figure.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The master bedroom is Uvior’s headquarters. If the party has not yet met
  Uvior, they meet him now, as in the Uvior Appears! encounter. There are always
  2d6+2 <b>Skeletons</b> in the master bedroom. Three of these skeletons are
  “Uvior’s Sentinels” and have leather-and-steel armor and wield kite shields
  and spears.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes have allied with Uvior, then they can Recoup and Take a Rest in
  the master bedroom without threat of danger.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>5 . LOUNGE</b></h2>
<p>
  The lounge looks much like the foyer, though it is a bit cozier. Dusty, worn
  couches and wall fireplaces are the only objects of note in this room.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The lounge is occupied by 1d6 <b>Skeletons</b>, who act as described in the
  Undead Horde random encounter.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>6. LIBRARY (UPPER BALCONY)</b></h2>
<p>
  A DC 18 INT/History check made on the third floor of the library will reveal
  one Greater Restoration scroll that any creature may use once.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The third floor of the library is otherwise functionally the same as the first
  floor, though without a hidden doorway. It connects to the lounge and one of
  the crenelated balconies overlooking the courtyard. A staircase connects the
  second and third floors of the library.
</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>BASEMENT</b></h2>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>1. SERVANT QUARTERS</b></h2>
<p>
<em>Rows of single beds afford little privacy, and these quarters look
    reminiscent of a barracks, with small chests at the foot of each bed for
    personal effects.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The servants’ quarters are austere and have nothing of interest, save a
  servant’s journal on one of the beds. The journal holds no information of
  great pertinence other than frequent ramblings about how the servants are
  discontented with Uvior. It seems that Uvior underpaid and overworked his
  servants, and treated them with a dismissive indifference that made him quite
  unpopular.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>2. KITCHEN STORAGE</b></h2>
<p>
  The cellar directly beneath the kitchens is for food storage. The smell is
  quite unpleasant, as most of the food has gone bad long ago. There are 1d6
  <b>Dire Rats</b> in this room, who will behave aggressively towards the party
  but will flee once one or more of the rats are Bloodied.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes investigate the cellar, they find wine and brandy that have both
  aged incredibly well. Each barrel is unwieldy, but would fetch 120 sc in a
  typical market.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Heroes that make a LUCK/Scavenging check can find a number of rations equal to
  ½ their roll. Furthermore, heroes that make an AWR/Investigating check find a
  recipe book that includes a unique magical inscription. The magic preserves 1
  ration’s worth of food for a decade. Creatures that access the Arcane Source
  can learn this magic and use it as an arcane ritual one time per month.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>3. STORAGE BASEMENT</b></h2>
<p>
<em>Crates and barrels pile upon one another in an unorganized jumble. White
    sheets have been pulled over some strange ornamentation, resulting in a
    facsimile of the ghosts from a child’s drawing.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes unveil the ornaments, they witness a horrible sight: dozens of
  realistic humanoid statues with expressions of terror. An urkou warrior,
  halfling mage, and human cleric are among them.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes open the various crates and boxes, they may each find one magic
  item. Each magic item has an Essence Point cost of 15 or fewer, and the MC may
  decide ahead of time which items the heroes find or allow the players to pick.
  Example items are included in <em>Appendix A.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  With a DC 14 AWR/Investigating check, the heroes also find a broken ball of
  crystal. If one of them touches this crystal, they briefly see a vision:
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<em>Uvior and his many guests fill the banquet hall, and a grand feast will
    soon begin. First, Uvior unveils the artifact that he has found: a strange
    metal object that looks like a flower but is as large as a human’s torso. He
    proudly declares that he will become immortal </em>–<em> and all of his friends can, too </em>–<em>
    but when he touches the object, blue-black energy explodes outward.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>When a hero sees this vision, they take 1d8 psychic damage.</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes use magic to determine the properties of this item, such as the
  Sense Magic spell, they can learn that it is from the Arcane Source and has
  the summoning function. An ability that discerns the exact spell will reveal
  that this is an Unerring Sphere that was broken by the power unleashed by the
  strange artifact.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes have the ability to use Greater Restoration, they can restore
  one statue to life. Upon being revived, a creature is too weary to physically
  help the heroes with anything, but will tell them Uvior’s story if they do not
  already know it. If they revive Humphrey the cleric, then he regains the
  ability to cast Greater Restoration 1 week after being revived and can
  subsequently revive the other petrified adventurers.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>4. UNDERCROFT</b></h2>
<p>
<em>The undercroft is dark and musty, the ground being packed earth rather than
    wood or stone. Wooden coffins have been slotted into the walls like books on
    a shelf, and a handful more stone coffins are pressed into the ground.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  There is nothing of note in the undercroft, but there are two hidden doorways
  in this room. One leads to the scriptorium and can be found with a DC 12
  AWR/Investigating check (it is easier to spot the false wall on this side of
  the doorway than it is from the scriptorium).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The other hidden doorway requires heroes to open one of the coffins pressed
  into the ground. If they open the coffin in the southwest corner of the room,
  they will find a stone stairway descending about 10 ft deeper underground.
  This stairway leads to a tunnel that connects to the storage basement. This
  passage can only be opened from this side.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>5. SCRIPTORIUM</b></h2>
<p>
<em>The scriptorium has several writing desks and stark, empty shelves. The
    desks are alight with cheerful candelabras. It smells of an odd mix of
    incense and faintly acidic slime. Many gretchlings idle in the room, playing
    cards or dice with one another, napping, or chatting. A gretchling with
    speckled skin wears a large, pointy wizard hat that falls over his froglike
    eyes, and he chats amicably with some of the others nearby.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The scriptorium is Mogg’s headquarters. It has magical wards that deter undead
  from entering the room. Any creatures with the undead tag in the scriptorium
  are Sickened until they leave.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the party has not yet met Mogg, they meet him now, as in the Mog Appears!
  encounter. At any given time, there are 3d6+3 <b>Gretchlings </b>in the
  scriptorium.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the heroes are allied with the gretchlings, they can Recoup or Take a Rest
  in the scriptorium without threat of danger.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  The scriptorium is brightly lit and safe. There is nothing otherwise
  noteworthy about the room, but a DC 17 AWR/Investigating check will reveal a
  hidden door that opens into the undercroft.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>THE SHOWDOWN</b></h2>
<p>
  Once the heroes have explored much of the manor, tensions between Uvior and
  Mogg will eventually force some form of showdown. This might be a battle
  between the heroes and Uvior or the heroes and Mogg, or it might be a tense
  negotiation brokered by the heroes.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>NEGOTIATION</b></h3>
<p>
  If the heroes attempt to negotiate a peace between Mogg and Uvior, they must
  first understand what both parties want.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Mogg’s desires are more transparent: he wants free rein over the manor so that
  he and the other gretchlings may feast on the various magic items therein.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Uvior keeps his desires closer to his chest, but the heroes might have
  discerned what he wants by exploring the manor. Uvior wants to undo the curse
  that he accidentally unleashed when he tried to activate the ancient artifact:
  he wants to be restored to his corporeal body. The Greater Restoration divine
  ritual can achieve this.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If the party has access to the Greater Restoration ritual, they can use it as
  leverage to get Uvior to negotiate. Mogg suggests that Uvior can keep his
  manor and be restored, but leaves all magic in the manor to be consumed by the
  gretchlings, whereupon they will leave him alone. Uvior does not like these
  terms, but is keen on being restored, so is willing to consider it.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Each hero must make CHA/Persuading checks; if the sum total of all heroes’
  rolls is less than the number of heroes x12, then Uvior agrees to the deal,
  but does not plan to uphold it. He intends to betray the gretchlings after he
  is restored to his corporeal body. A hero that succeeds on a DC 14
  AWR/Intuiting check can see Uvior’s plans. If they do not call him out, then
  they can leave the manor unharmed but with the knowledge that Uvior will
  retaliate against the gretchlings. If they do call him out, then Uvior becomes
  hostile and combat begins.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  However, if the sum total of the heroes’ CHA/Persuading checks is equal to or
  greater than the number of heroes x12, then Uvior reluctantly agrees to the
  deal and will uphold his end of the bargain. The heroes are granted treasure
  as though they had made an alliance with both Uvior and Mogg, and all parties
  get more or less what they want.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>BATTLE</b></h3>
<p>If the showdown is a battle, use these stat blocks and tactics.</p>
<img data-filename="MCG-FPO-31" src="https://files.d20.io/images/475971301/xVdrzkiEdpSEEVEAcY04MA/original.png?1771164466" style="width: 276px; float: right"/>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>FIGHTING UVIOR</b></h3>
<p>
  Uvior fights with great tact, snuffing out light sources to keep the upper
  hand and summoning skeletons to overwhelm the heroes. He tries not to engage
  in melee, using his abilities to keep the heroes at bay. He tries to
  continuously maintain a tether so that he can pass damage off to other
  creatures whenever he is harmed.
</p>

</h3>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>RESOLUTION</b></h2>
<p>
  The adventure ends when the animosity between Uvior and Mogg is resolved. This
  will happen in one of three ways:
</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>The party confronts and defeats Uvior.</li>
<li>The party confronts and defeats Mogg.</li>
<li>The party negotiates a peace between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The best possible outcome for the heroes is negotiating a peace between Uvior
  and Mogg, and using Greater Restoration on Humphrey the Cleric. Doing so will
  result in the heroes getting the maximum amount of treasure from both Uvior
  and Mogg (see their respective random encounter entries for this treasure),
  and earns them +4 Goodwill whenever they enter a settlement that is home to an
  adventurer who was turned to stone at Uvior’s tragic banquet.
</p>
