<p>
  Designing a campaign can be a daunting task. It might be difficult to know
  where to begin, or what questions to ask yourself as you outline your world.
  This chapter covers the fundamental elements of a MythCraft campaign and how
  to consider crafting your own myths.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  In addition to memorable heroes, villains, and supporting characters, there
  are a few key elements that contribute to making a memorable campaign: Themes,
  Plot, and Setting.
</p>

<h2>
  <b>THEMES</b>
</h2>

<p>
  The themes of your campaign can be thought of as the lifeblood of your story,
  the pulse around which heroes, villains, and plot elements occur. This is not
  to say that the themes of your campaign need to be in the foreground at all
  times. Quite the contrary; themes can usually be the unspoken backdrop against
  which the story takes place.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  When considering the themes that you want your campaign to explore, it can be
  helpful to think of one or two dichotomies that interest you. Think about how
  these dichotomies can come up in the world, how they might manifest themselves
  in the actions of the heroes or villains, and how the setting might reflect
  these themes.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  If you are looking for a place to start, you can roll once or twice on the
  following table and see if the randomly selected themes spark your interest.
  Remember that this is YOUR game, so do not feel tied to any specific themes
  you see on this table. These suggestions are just meant to get your ideas
  flowing!

<h2>
  <b>PLOT</b>
</h2>
<p>
  When thinking about the overarching plot of your campaign, it is best not to
  get bogged down in specifics. Think about how you want your game to start, a
  few different endings that you think would be satisfying, and two or three
  mid-campaign milestones that can help orient you towards one or more dramatic
  endings.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Remember that while you facilitate the story, your players are the real
  heroes. They will likely take the story in directions that you did not
  originally intend, which is why it is usually not constructive to plan out
  your entire campaign in meticulous detail.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Forcing your players to do exactly what you prepared for is colloquially
  called “railroading,” and is generally discouraged. If your players do not
  particularly care and want you to just lead them through a fun journey, then
  it can be a fine method of gameplay, but players will typically want to have
  the agency to make their own decisions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  So long as it is disguised as the veneer of choice, you can also lightly lead
  your players with some narrative techniques such as only preparing what lies
  behind one door. Regardless of which door the players open, they find what you
  prepared for them. Again, this technique should be used sparingly, but it can
  be useful when you are caught by surprise or need to be sure that a specific
  plot point comes up.
</p>
<h3><b>CAMPAIGN PLOTS</b></h3>
<p>
  Here are a few ideas that you might use to generate your campaign’s
  overarching storyline. These plot ideas can be mixed with one another or used
  individually. Note that MythCraft is designed with the intent that campaigns
  can span in-world decades, so you do not always have to immediately rush the
  heroes to their next mission. This can allow the world to develop more
  naturally and will help the players feel invested in all aspects of their
  heroes’ lives. You can also mix two or more types of campaign plots to create
  a more interesting overarching dynamic.<br />
</p>
<h4><b>ADVENTURE/QUEST</b></h4>
<p>
  The adventure or quest is the classic heroic journey. The adventurers have a
  destination that they must reach for one reason or another, and they meet
  enemies, setbacks, and allies along the way. All the while, they get to learn
  more and more about the wondrous world around them.<br />
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />CHANGE STATUS</b>
</h4>
<p>
  Things in the world are not right, and your adventurers set out to bring about
  change. Perhaps this is overthrowing a corrupt regime or clearing the name of
  a wrongly charged convict.<br />
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />FISHTANK</b>
</h4>
<p>
  In a fishtank campaign, the villain already gained unrivaled power, and the
  heroes live in the villain’s world whether they know it or not. The villain is
  the dominant authority around them. Perhaps the heroes’ employer is the
  villain and the players must uncover this secret, or perhaps they know they
  live in an cruel and unjust empire and take it upon themselves to start a
  revolt.<br />
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />HERO VS ENVIRONMENT</b>
</h4>
<p>
  A hero vs environment campaign pits the heroes not against a specific villain,
  but against the larger environment. This might be a natural disaster that
  threatens a small town or a logging company trying to deforest the heroes’
  home. Maybe the heroes are the only survivors of a merchant caravan and must
  find a way to endure a harsh winter in the open elements. The heroes must band
  together to overcome whatever environmental challenge faces them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Depending on the crisis, they may need to journey to various places, ask for
  aid, issue warnings, and complete quests to gain people’s trust.<br />
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />MAINTAIN STATUS</b>
</h4>
<p>
  Sometimes, heroes need to change the status quo; other times, they need to
  maintain it. When villains stir and attempt to topple the world order, heroes
  might try to thwart the villains’ efforts, deal with monarchs and politicians,
  and try to maintain the balance of the powers that be.
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />SANDBOX</b>
</h4>
<p>
  In a sandbox campaign, there is no clear objective. The heroes get to
  construct their own path based on what they find the most interesting in the
  world that you present to them. There are likely several potential main
  villains, but it is wise not to plan out too much beyond the first few actions
  of the party. Instead, react to what seems to engage them most.
</p>
<h3><b>CAMPAIGN PLOT TWISTS</b></h3>
<p>
  These are a few ideas that you can use around the midpoint of a campaign, or
  at a significant milestone, to orient yourself and the adventurers towards the
  last few chapters of your story.
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />CHANGING SIDES</b>
</h4>
<p>
  As the campaign world unfolds, you may find that the adventurers, villains, or
  supporting characters no longer hold the same views that they did at the
  campaign’s outset. Having a significant character change sides in a conflict
  can be a very notable midpoint for a campaign and can radically change the
  direction of the remainder of the story.
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />EVIL QUESTGIVER</b>
</h4>
<p>
  It is a trope that can be overused, so be careful when implementing the Evil
  Questgiver. If the heroes have gone on a quest, and it turns out that it was
  all for their benefactor’s nefarious designs, this can be a meaningful plot
  twist, but should be used sparingly.<br />
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />MOVING THE GOALPOSTS</b>
</h4>
<p>
  A common way to continually up the stakes in an adventure is to move the
  goalposts each time the heroes make an accomplishment. After defeating someone
  that they thought was the main villain, they find out that the
  <em>real </em>villain was his mother.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Like the Evil Questgiver, moving the goalposts either on what you need to
  complete a quest or on who the real villain is can quickly become a tired
  trope, so be careful when you implement this device.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you do use this plot twist, it can work very well with a character changing
  sides, becoming allies with the heroes as they explain who is really
  threatening the world.
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />THE REAL TREASURE WAS…</b>
</h4>
<p>
  Talk about tired tropes. We all know this adage. And yet, knowing how and when
  to implement this trope can lead to some very heartwarming moments. It can
  also deliver home the reason that specific heroes found themselves on a life
  of adventure. Why was it <em>these specific heroes </em>that ended up being
  the only ones that could succeed on this campaign? What is it about how they
  interact with each other, or how they bring new friends to their cause, that
  makes them succeed where others might fail?
</p>
<h2>
  <b>SETTING</b>
</h2>
<p>
  While you do not need to have the entire campaign’s plot planned out in detail
  before you begin, it can be beneficial to have a well established campaign
  setting.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  At minimum, think about how the setting might reflect or interact with the
  themes that you want to explore. Consider how the physical world and the
  political landscape might challenge the heroes or direct them towards or away
  from certain actions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To make the world feel real and lived in, consider what season you want to
  start the story in and the reasoning for that decision. Think about in-world
  holidays and traditions to ground the setting in believable customs that the
  inhabitants of your world observe.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When the heroes are in a settled area, be it a small village or a sprawling
  metropolis, think about the region’s social, criminal, political, economic,
  religious, and military practices to quickly sketch out how the area works and
  what beliefs might commonly be held. You can also think about this in the
  context of your world’s history and the major economic or political players in
  the region. A small village under the shadow of a tyrant’s castle will feel
  markedly different than a village of the same size that is in the middle of
  nowhere in the woods, answerable to no one but themselves.
</p>
<h3><b>HISTORY AND PRESENT DAY</b></h3>
<p>
  As you work on fleshing out your campaign setting, you can also consider how
  your world’s history affects your present day setting. Are nations generally
  friendly with one another, or are they on the brink or currently engaged in
  war? How much of a focus will this be in your adventurers’ lives?
</p>
<h2>
  <b>ADVENTURE ARCS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Adventure arcs are the sections that make up a campaign, kind of like chapters
  in a novel. Planning an adventure arc is a little different than planning an
  entire campaign, but many of the same principles apply.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Consider what the heroes and villains stand to gain in an adventure arc and
  what their motives likely are. Think about how and where the adventure arc
  will conclude. How does this propel the campaign forward? What new revelations
  will the heroes make, and what treasure or plot-relevant items might they
  find?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Should this adventure arc have a notable plot twist? If so, how much will it
  impact the adventure, and how much will it ripple out and impact the whole
  campaign? NPCs that reveal new key information are a common way to introduce
  minor plot twists or noteworthy revelations into a story.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You can also increase tension and drama in an adventure arc by splitting the
  interests of the party. Offer them two or more options for how to proceed,
  where each option might be good or bad for different reasons and might appeal
  to different members of the party. This can lead to intense conflict between
  the adventurers, which in turn can lead to some very meaningful moments once
  they reach an accord or go their separate ways.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When designing an adventure arc, it can be helpful to think of a verb around
  which the adventure revolves. The more specific the verb, the stronger a
  guiding principle it can serve as for the adventure. Some examples include:
  capture, defeat, explore, persuade, obtain, protect, or rescue.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>SESSIONS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  In the same way that a campaign is made up of adventures, an adventure is made
  up of sessions. A session is a single instance of playing the game and game
  sessions usually last 2-5 hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When prepping for a session, ask yourself what the heroes have done up to this
  point and what they are likely to do moving forward. Prepare a few combat
  encounters as necessary and think about plot twists that you might utilize.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Having a couple combat encounters, a few social encounters, and one or two
  potential plot twists or revelations on hand will help you run a more seamless
  game as you can react to the various things your adventurers do.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>ONE-SHOTS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A one-shot is a unique experience where the entire campaign begins and ends
  over the course of a single session. One-shots can be nice because they are
  self-contained, allowing you and your friends to play through an entire story
  in one sitting. This is a great format for trying new character concepts that
  you may or may not like, because if you end up not liking it, you are not tied
  to that character for any future sessions. However, one-shots can also be
  tough to run due to their short nature: they involve introducing an entire
  adventure, running it, and wrapping it up all in the span of just a few hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When running a one-shot, do not make too grand of a plan. Direct stories with
  clear goals are usually best for one-shots, though of course you can still
  throw in a red herring or plot twist to mislead and surprise your players.
</p>
<h2><b>CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT</b></h2>
<p>
  Like most TTRPGs, MythCraft campaigns involve the heroes getting better over
  time. Each time a character gains a level, they gain more HP, an additional
  Attribute Point, and a new talent. But when should heroes level up?
</p>
<h3><b>MILESTONE PROGRESSION</b></h3>
<p>
  Given MythCraft’s focus on compelling narratives, milestone progression is the
  ideal method to use when determining if characters should level up. Using this
  method, when the heroes have achieved a notable milestone, they all level up.
  Depending on how quickly you want your heroes to advance, these milestones
  should come every 3-5 sessions on average. Milestones might be as significant
  as thwarting the main villain’s plans or defeating one of the villain’s
  notable lieutenants. Milestones might also be less significant, such as
  completing a side quest for a local community.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Milestone leveling allows you to carefully curtail how and when the heroes
  gain power, enabling you to shape your campaign according to your vision.
</p>
<br />

      <td>
        <h4><b>THE ADVENTURING DAY</b></h4>
        <p>
          Many days and weeks in the life of a hero may pass uneventfully.
          Traveling from one city to another along well-worn pathways in a safe
          kingdom is likely to produce no noteworthy adventures, and such
          journeys can be quickly narrated with a brief montage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Other days in an adventurer’s life are riddled with challenges. A day
          at court may have several social encounters, while a day in the
          wilderness might have multiple combat and exploration encounters. Some
          days, such as exploring populated dungeons or investigating crimes in
          a violent city, may have all three major types of encounters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Whether you use Milestone or XP progression, you can use this
          guideline to make adventures challenging for your heroes. On average,
          a day that poses a legitimate challenge to the adventuring party
          should have 4-6 encounters of medium difficulty, or 2-4 medium
          encounters and 1-2 difficult or deadly ones.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Adventuring days that punish heroes with Fatigue make the following
          day quite challenging as well, so factor this in when determining how
          many encounters to present to your party.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>EXPERIENCE POINTS</b></h3>
<p>
  Some tables may prefer a more mechanical approach to leveling up. If this is
  the case, you may use the following rules to determine when your heroes get to
  level up.
</p>
<h4>
  <b><br />GAINING XP</b>
</h4>
<p>
  Heroes gain Experience Points (XP) when they achieve certain feats, such as
  winning a fight (or avoiding one), negotiating with an influential figure, or
  exploring a new locale, among other situations.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  After each game session, add up the total XP that your party earned by
  consulting the following tables. Divide that total XP by the number of heroes;
  each hero gains XP equal to the quotient.
</p>
<br />
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h4><b>OPTIONAL RULE: EPIC HEROISM</b></h4>
        <p>
          If you use XP to level your heroes up, consider using either variant
          of this optional rule. It will encourage your players to go above and
          beyond in their combat strategy and roleplaying efforts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Variant 1: </b>When a hero does something truly remarkable in
          combat or a social encounter, award that hero 20 additional XP.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Variant 2: </b>When a hero acts remarkably in combat or a social
          encounter, award all heroes in the party 10 additional XP.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>
  When consulting this table, remember that “winning” an encounter could be
  achieved by circumventing the encounter altogether. If the heroes are
  confronted with a difficult combat encounter but manage to resolve it by
  negotiating with their foes, they should still be awarded full XP as though
  they won the encounter.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The same amount of XP should be awarded for overcoming any kind of encounter:
  combat, exploration, social, or something that falls in between these three
  broad categories.
</p>
<br />

      <td><b>Difficulty</b></td>
      <td><b>Balance</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trivial</td>
      <td>Total enemy ML = ½ total party level -3 or more</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Easy</td>
      <td>Total enemy ML = ½ total party level -1 to -2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Total enemy ML = ½ total party level</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Very Deadly</td>
      <td>Total enemy ML = ½ total party level +5 or more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>
  For example, if an adventuring party consists of four level 3 heroes, their
  total party level is 12. A normal combat encounter would pit them against
  enemies whose total ML equals 6. A deadly combat encounter might pit them
  against enemies whose total ML is 9 or 10. The deadly encounter would grant
  the party a total of 60 XP, or 15 each.

      <td>Deadly</td>
      <td>
        If the party fails, they might lose 1-3 Goodwill or be seen unfavorably

        in jail or run out of town.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Very Deadly</td>
      <td>
        If the party fails, they might lose 4-6 Goodwill or be seen unfavorably
        by someone with as much influence as a king or high priest. They might
        be run out of town or imprisoned and sentenced to execution.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>
  For example, an easy social encounter might entail haggling with a merchant
  that sells valuable wares. A deadly one might involve the heroes trying to
  discredit a powerful member of society.

<p>
  Note that exploration encounters will be much easier for high-level
  characters. If your adventuring party is level 11-20, then decrease each
  difficulty level by 1 when calculating XP. If they are level 21-30, decrease
  each difficulty level by 2. This means that a Very Deadly exploration
  encounter for a level 8 party would only be Deadly for a level 16 party, and
  only Difficult for a level 24 party.

<h3><b>LEVELING UP WITH XP</b></h3>
<p>
  When using XP to track character progression, heroes level up by spending XP.
  When they spend the appropriate amount of XP, they gain a level. For example,
  if Andi is playing Lyla and is level 1, once she earns 120 XP, she may spend
  100 to advance to level 2. She now has 20 XP, and once she earns enough, she
  can spend 100 more XP to advance to level 3.
