<h2><b>Initiative</b></h2>
<p>
  Combat begins when all creatures involved roll Initiative.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Initiative determines the order in which creatures take their turn during
  combat.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Initiative is an Awareness (AWR) check: each creature rolls 1d20 and adds
  their AWR. The one with the highest roll goes first, followed by the
  second-highest, and so on. After the last creature takes its turn, the first
  creature takes its second turn. Initiative order is repeated until combat is
  resolved.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  In the event of a tie between one or more creatures, the creature with the
  higher AWR goes first out of those creatures. If one or more creatures tie and
  have the same AWR, roll unmodified d20s for each tied creature; the highest
  roll goes first out of those creatures, then the second highest, etc.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Remember that if you are encumbered, you must set down all items that are
  causing you to be encumbered before you can equip a weapon or a shield. Rules
  on encumbrance can be found in Chapter 6 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.

<br />
<p>You may spend your AP as you deem appropriate on your turn.</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you do not spend all your AP, this turns into Reactive AP that you may
  spend on someone else's turn if you have an ability allowing you to do so.
  This is referred to as a Reactive Action.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When you start your next turn, you can carry over a finite amount of Reactive
  AP. You can retain no more Reactive AP than ½ your level + 1. (I.e., a level 1
  or 2 character can retain 2 Reactive AP, a level 3 or 4 character can retain 3
  Reactive AP, etc.) At the start of your turn, you add this remaining Reactive
  AP to your new pool of AP.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Note: </b>Some features, like the Berzerker's Blood Rage and the Cleric's
  Holy Support ability, allow you additional AP (respectively, "Rage AP" and
  "Support AP") that follow special rules. You can only ever have one source of
  special AP. If you would gain more than one source of special AP, you can
  choose which type of special AP you keep.
</p>
<h2><b>ACTIONS</b></h2>
<p>
  Actions cost varying amounts of AP, referred to as Action Point Costs (APC).
  You can do any combination of things on your turn, in any order you wish,
  provided you have enough AP to spend, and you can spend AP on the same action
  multiple times in a turn.
</p>
<h3><b>MOVE</b></h3>
<p>
  All adventurers start with a base speed of 20 ft. You can spend 1 AP to move
  up to your Speed. This movement ends when you spend your next AP.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you have a Climb, Swim, Fly, or Burrow speed, that means that you can do
  those kinds of movements as well. If you combine movements (say you run, then
  fly over a trench, then keep running) - you use the largest movement number
  for your total movement (instead of adding them together), and cannot move
  more than your maximum speed in any specific type of movement. For example:
</p>
<br />
<p>If you have Speed 20, Swim 20, and Fly 30, then for 1 AP:</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>You can run 10 ft, swim 10 ft, and fly 10 ft</li>
  <li>You cannot swim 30 ft</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you do not have a climb speed or a swim speed, but wish to climb a surface
  or swim, it costs 2ft of movement for every 1ft that you actually move. If the
  surface might be challenging to climb, then your MC might also require you to
  make a STR check, and if you have the Athletics skill, you can add that bonus
  to checks of this nature.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A climb speed automatically allows you to climb vertical surfaces, but not
  upside-down (such as ceilings).
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Difficult Terrain costs 2 ft of movement for every 1 ft that you actually
  move. Hazardous Terrain costs as much movement as Difficult Terrain, and will
  also specify an amount of damage that you take for every 5 ft actually moved.
</p>
<h3><b>JUMP</b></h3>
<p>
  While moving, you may need to jump. You cannot jump farther than you can move.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Your vertical jump distance is 3ft + a number of ft equal to your STR.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Your horizontal jump distance is double your vertical jump distance.
</p>
<h3><b>MOVING THROUGH CREATURES</b></h3>
<p>
  You may move through an allied creature's space, but this counts as difficult
  terrain. You may not end your turn in an allied creature's space.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You may not move through a hostile creature's space unless that creature is
  Paralyzed, Restrained, Unconscious, or at least 3 Sizes larger than you. In
  that case, moving through a hostile creature's space counts as difficult
  terrain.
</p>
<h3><b>WEAPON ATTACKS</b></h3>
<p>
  When a creature is in range, you may make an attack. To make an attack, you
  roll 1d20 and apply a modifier based on one of your attributes (usually STR or
  DEX). You compare your total modified roll to the target's appropriate defense
  (usually their Armor Rating); if your attack equals or exceeds the target's
  defense, then you hit them and they take some form of damage. If your attack
  roll is lower than the target's defense, then your attack misses.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Each weapon specifies how many AP it takes to make an attack with it. Some
  have set numbers of AP, and others have high APCs that you can lower through
  training.
</p>
<h3><b>SPELLS AND MAGIC</b></h3>
<p>
  Spells will specify how many AP you need to use them. Spells also require you
  to expend SP; if you are out of SP, you cannot cast a spell.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Cantrips, chants, and prayers specify how many AP you need to use them; they
  do not cost any SP, so they can be done as many times as you wish.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Rituals and invocations take a significantly longer time to cast; each ritual
  or invocation will specify how long it takes to cast it.
</p>
<h3><b>CRITICAL HITS</b></h3>
<p>
  Sometimes, fate turns decisively in your favor or sways brutally against you.
  When you roll d20 and the number is a 20 before adding any modifiers, this is
  considered a critical hit (or a crit). Conversely, if you roll a 1 before
  adding any modifiers, this is a critical fail.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When you make an attribute check, if you critically fail, then the worst
  possible outcome of the scene befalls you. This might range in severity from
  being publicly embarrassed by a rival socialite to missing a foothold on a
  sheer cliff and plummeting to your death.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you crit on an attribute check, then you achieve the best outcome that it
  was feasible for you to achieve. A crit does not defy reality. If you crit on
  a STR check with the Athletics skill, for example, then you still cannot lift
  an entire castle, but you might lift more than you have ever managed before.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When making an attack, you automatically miss on a critical fail, even if you
  would have a high enough bonus to hit normally. Likewise, you automatically
  hit on a crit, regardless of the target's defenses.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Additionally, if you crit with a weapon (including unarmed and natural
  weapons), you deal critical damage When dealing critical damage, maximize the
  amount of weapon damage that you would normally do (including any modifiers),
  and then roll your damage dice a second time. After that, add any additional
  sources of damage, such as Sneak Attack. Furthermore, you add your LUCK score
  to your damage total when you deal critical damage.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you crit with a magical ability, you add your LUCK to your damage.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Various abilities might let you expand your crit range. This means that you
  crit on a lower d20 roll, allowing you to crit more frequently. If you would
  normally crit on a roll of 20, and you have an ability that increases your
  crit range by 1, then you crit on a roll of 19-20.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  No matter how many abilities you have that let you increase your crit range,
  your crit range can never be larger than 16-20.
</p>
<h3><b>RANGED ATTACKS IN MELEE</b></h3>
<p>
  If you make a ranged attack or thrown attack with a weapon, spell, or any
  other effect and a hostile creature is within 5 ft of you, you suffer 1
  Tactical Disadvantage for each hostile creature within 5 ft of you.

</table>
<h3><b>FLANKING</b></h3>
<p>
  The Flanking condition is achieved when two friendly targets threaten a border
  or corner opposite of one another.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You are only considered to threaten a square if you are able to melee attack
  that square. A Prone creature can flank, for example, but an Unconscious one
  cannot.
</p>
<h3><b>COVER</b></h3>
<p>
  By hiding behind a barrier of some sort, you might gain cover. This will
  enhance your AR and physical defenses, or might make it impossible to target
  you altogether.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Cover is a physical barrier that can block attacks, while something that
  obscures you but does not physically block you from a source of danger might
  give you the Concealed condition. When you have total cover, you are also
  Concealed.
</p>
<h2><b>Tactical Advantage and Disadvantage</b></h2>
<p>
  Tactical Advantage (TA) and Tactical Disadvantage (TD) are situational bonuses
  and penalties that can accrue in combat. Each TA is a +1 bonus, and TD is a -1
  penalty. TA and TD can accrue indefinitely. When you roll a d20, add all your
  sources of TA and TD together and add the sum to your roll. You might have
  several sources of TA and TD at once, so be sure to account for all sources!
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You may also gain TA through clever implementation of conditions, such as
  attacking a Prone target. Your MC might also grant you TA for narrative
  reasons, such as having the high ground while dueling your corrupted
  apprentice.
</p>
<h3><b>DAMAGE</b></h3>
<p>
  When you hit with an attack, you often deal damage.
</p>
<h3><b>DEALING DAMAGE</b></h3>
<p>
  When you hit with a weapon attack, magic attack, and the like, you often deal
  damage. Roll the amount of damage specified by your weapon, spell, etc.; the
  creature that you hit loses that many HP, subtracting it from their Current
  HP. Weapons are unique in that they add one of your attributes to the amount
  of damage dealt. The attribute is specified by each weapon type (<em
    >CRB Ch. 6 "Equipment"</em
  >). Your attack will also deal a specific type of damage.
</p>
<h3><b>DAMAGE TYPES</b></h3>
<p>
  There are 11 types of damage, divided across three categories:
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Physical Damage: </b>Blunt, Sharp</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Elemental Damage: </b>Cold, Corrosive, Electric, Fire, Toxic
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Energy Damage: </b>Necrotic, Psychic, Radiant, Sonic</p>
<h3><b>SHIELD HP</b></h3>
<p>
  Shield HP is a special type of HP that temporarily bolsters a creature. When
  you take damage, subtract that damage from your Shield HP first, then from
  your actual HP. You cannot benefit from multiple sources of Shield HP at once;
  if you would receive multiple sources of Shield HP or would receive multiple
  instances of Shield HP from the same source, you can take whichever would give
  you more Shield HP.
</p>
<h3><b>RESIST</b></h3>
<p>
  Resist adds the specified number to a creature's defenses against that type of
  damage. When a creature with Resist X is attacked, and that attack would deal
  damage or impose a condition specified by the Resist feature or is made using
  a weapon type or magic source specified by the Resist feature, then the
  creature adds their Resist number to their defenses, making it less likely
  that they are hit. If an attack does multiple types of damage or would do
  damage and impose a condition, this could result in separate attack values.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example: A Thresher Moss has Resist Cold 3. If it is targeted by an
  ability that deals cold damage, then the Thresher Moss adds 3 to their
  relevant defense. If the Thresher Moss is targeted by an ability that would
  deal both cold damage and necrotic damage, then the Thresher Moss compares the
  attack roll against its defenses +3 to determine if it takes cold damage, and
  the attack roll unmodified against its defenses to determine if it takes
  necrotic damage.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Resist is more powerful when it specifies a weapon type or a magic source,
  because if a creature Resists Primal then they apply their Resist to every
  attack roll that targets them if it is Primal Magic.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When an attack misses a creature and would deal ½ damage on a miss, if the
  creature Resists that kind of damage, they take no damage instead of ½.
</p>
<h3><b>VULNERABLE</b></h3>
<p>
  A creature with Vulnerable X subtracts the specified number from their
  defenses against any attack roll that would deal that type of damage.
  Furthermore, when a creature attacks a Vulnerable creature with that type of
  damage, the attacking creature's crit range is increased by the Vulnerable
  number.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example, if a Skeleton is Vulnerable Blunt 2, then when Marcus attacks
  with his morningstar and deals blunt damage, he would crit on a roll of 18-20,
  instead of just 20.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Vulnerable always supersedes Resist or Immune. For example, a creature that
  has Resist Fire 3 and Vulnerable Occult 1 still suffers the Vulnerable 1
  penalty against the Occult Source without gaining the Resist bonus. Vulnerable
  always trumps DR and DT. No benefits are gained from DR and DT against a
  damage type to which a creature is Vulnerable.
</p>
<h3><b>IMMUNE</b></h3>
<p>
  If a creature is Immune to a damage type, they can never take damage of that
  type. If a creature is Immune to a condition, poison, or diesease, they are
  never affected by that condition, poison, or disease.
</p>
<h3><b>DAMAGE REDUCTION</b></h3>
<p>
  If a creature has Damage Reduction (DR) X, they subtract their DR number from
  all damage they take, unless they are Vulnerable to the type of damage that
  they are taking.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If damage specifies that it ignores Resist, it also ignores DR.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The DR number may be followed by a weapon tag, magic source, or damage type.
  This means that creature takes full damage from a weapon with that tag or
  damage type. For example, a creature with DR 5/Fire would take full damage
  from fire, and subtract 5 from all other sources of damage. A creature with DR
  15/Silvered Weapons would take full damage from silvered weapons, and subtract
  15 from all other damage.
</p>
<h3><b>DAMAGE THRESHOLD</b></h3>
<p>
  Damage Threshold (DT) is a very rare defense that is typically seen on
  structures and vehicles. DT determines how much damage a creature must deal at
  once to deal any damage at all. For example, if a stone wall has DT 15, and a
  player deals 14 damage to it, it instead takes 0. If a player deals 16 damage,
  conversely, then the stone wall takes all 16 damage because its DT 15 was
  overcome.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For the purposes of overcoming DT, "damage dealt at once" is determined by a
  single expenditure of AP. Each expenditure of AP for an attack is a new roll
  against DT; you cannot stack attacks to overcome DT.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example: A spell deals multiple damage sources, such as 2d8 fire damage
  and 2d8 blunt damage. Since that spell is one expenditure of AP, add them
  together to determine if it overcomes DT.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A player makes two maul attacks against a stone wall on the same turn. Because
  these are two expenditures of AP, do not add the damage together from the two
  attacks to determine if they overcome DT.
</p>
<h3><b>MASSIVE DAMAGE</b></h3>
<p>
  Sometimes, brutal amounts of damage can devastate you in a single strike. If
  you take enough damage that you would reach negative HP equal to your maximum
  HP, you gain 4 Death Points.
</p>
<h2><b>DYING</b></h2>
<p>
  When you are reduced to 0 HP, you begin dying. If you end your turn with 0 HP,
  you gain 1 Death Point.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you would take damage and have 0 HP, you gain 2 Death Points.
</p>
<br />
<p>Once you have 8 Death Points, you die.</p>
<br />
<p>
  While Catching your Breath, you do not gain Death Points, even if you end your
  turn with 0 HP.
</p>
<br />
<p>Each time you Recoup, remove 1 Death Point.</p>
<br />
<p>Each time you Rest, remove all Death Points.</p>
<h2><b>KNOCKING UNCONSCIOUS</b></h2>
<p>
  A creature that deals blunt damage can choose to deal nonlethal damage.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When a creature reduces you to 0 HP with nonlethal damage, you regain 1 HP and
  become Dazed. If you were already Dazed, you regain 1 HP and become Stunned.
  If you were already Stunned, you regain 1 HP and fall Unconscious.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When Dazed or Stunned in this way, you remove the condition when you are no
  longer Bloodied or when you have 15 or more HP (whichever is lower), or when
  you Catch your Breath.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The MC may determine whether or not NPCs follow this process to fall
  Unconscious.
</p>
<h2><b>COMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS</b></h2>
<p>
  Spells and magical effects of exactly the same name cannot stack on a target.
  The newer effect always replaces the older effect.
</p>
<h2><b>CONDITIONS</b></h2>
<p>
  If a condition does not specify a duration, or a way to resolve it (such as
  spending AP to stand from Prone), it lasts for one full round. The condition
  lasts until the end of the affected creature's turn.
</p>
