  A much larger and more powerful cousin to the catapult, a trebuchet is dozens
  of feet tall and can hurl stone balls almost as far as a cannon. Beasts that
  can carry seven or more unwieldy items can drag a trebuchet if it is mounted
  on wheels. A team of beasts that can collectively carry that many unwieldy
  items can also move the trebuchet. Trebuchets cost 9,000 sc.

  A creature within 5 ft of the Trebuchet can spend 4 AP to make a siege weapon
  attack vs the FORT of each target in the radius. This attack suffers a -2
  penalty against Medium or smaller targets. <b>Hit: </b>6d10 blunt and the
  target falls Prone. <b>Miss: </b>½ damage and the target does not fall Prone.
  If the ball did not impact a surface (such as targeting a flying creature), it
  does not use its AOE radius and does no damage on a miss.
