<p>
  Any MythCraft campaign should revolve, first and foremost, around the heroes
  and villains of the story. The heroes will be the characters played by the
  various players at your table, while the villains are their direct or indirect
  adversaries.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This chapter provides tools for thinking about your campaign’s heroes and
  villains, along with fleshing out the supporting cast of NPCs that are not
  necessarily for or against your heroes. This chapter also contains metrics
  that you can use when considering the motives, personalities, and values of
  your villains and minor NPCs.
</p>

<p>
  If you need to quickly improvise an NPC, use <em>Appendix A </em>for
  inspiration.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>HEROES</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The adventurers that your players present to you are the main characters of
  your story. They should be the focus of your campaign, and you should seek to
  elevate them as the protagonists.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  As you work with your players to craft their heroes, think about how they fit
  into the world that you have in mind. It is okay to turn down a player’s idea
  for their adventurer. A space smuggler with a laser gun does not belong in a
  world that has not yet discovered electricity. That said, work with your
  players to incorporate as many of their ideas as possible into your world.
  This will make them feel invested in the world before the first session.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Think about your adventurers’ backstories and your players’ vision for their
  adventurers to grow. Are these heroes well known in the world already, or have
  they yet to earn their renown? Typically, adventurers at the beginning of a
  campaign are not yet well known beyond their homes unless they are
  politicians, entertainers, or similar public figures.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Be sure to integrate the heroes’ backstories into your world. These
  backstories do not need to come up every time you play the game, but when
  possible, tug on a plot thread from a character’s backstory so that the player
  feels more immediately invested in your campaign’s story as it unfolds.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>VILLAINS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  It is often said that a story is only as great as its villain. It is usually
  best to have one or more clear villains in mind when you conceptualize your
  campaign. This can change once you actually start playing the campaign, as
  your players might take the story in a direction that steers you away from
  using the villain that you had originally planned. Even so, having a few clear
  antagonists in mind will help you plan the milestones that your adventurers
  might achieve over the game. These principles also work for considering a new
  antagonist if your party takes the campaign in an unexpected direction.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  As you plan your campaign’s main villains, ask yourself a few questions to
  better understand the villain’s motives:
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>What does the villain want?</li>
  <li>What does the villain need?</li>
  <li>Does the villain have anything that the heroes need? If so, what?</li>
  <li>Do the heroes have anything that the villain needs? If so, what?</li>
  <li>What are the villain’s driving motives?</li>
  <li>Is the villain supposed to be sympathetic or redemptive in any way?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When creating your villains, take some time to consider how they might act and
  react in different situations. What might they say or do when your campaign
  reaches key milestones? Using the Values, Drives, and Quirks at the end of
  this chapter can help you create much more nuanced and realistic villains.
  Think about what motivates your villain and what event in their past led them
  down the path that they are on now. Even if the villain never tells their
  story to the heroes, it will be very helpful for you to know why they make the
  decisions that they do. Consider a list of things that will trigger them to
  act in certain ways, or events and circumstances that might give them pause or
  even make them reconsider their actions.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>A VILLAIN’S DRIVING MOTIVES</b></h3>
<p>
  Villains seldom think of themselves as such. Most are firmly committed to
  their actions and believe themselves to be heroes, or at least to be a
  necessary evil for some ultimate greater good. Consider what your villain’s
  driving motive is. If you want some inspiration, feel free to roll on the
  following table and see if the result triggers an idea for your villain.
</p>

</table>
<br />
<p>
  There are many other possible motives that might drive your villain; the table
  is simply meant to help you start brainstorming ideas.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><b>MAKE THEM </b><b>MEMORABLE</b></b>
</h2>
<p>
  The best villains are deeply memorable. They should command fear, or respect,
  or contempt. Just by walking into a room, they become the focus of the scene.
  Think about your villain’s appearance. What about them is striking or commands
  attention? Perhaps it is their imposing stature, a menacing voice, or a
  terrifying outfit. Maybe it is a combination of all three.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that it is also possible to make memorable villains that are not
  physically menacing. A soft-spoken criminal mastermind can be a terrifying
  rival.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Like heroes, villains are not without virtue, nor are they perfectly
  self-aware. Consider what virtues and flaws your villains might have and how
  this will inform their actions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  In addition to considering how they present themselves, think about what kind
  of villain you are running. Below are some ideas for running a handful of
  villain archetypes that will contribute to making your villains memorable.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CHAOTIC VILLAINS</b></h3>
<p>
  While complex villains that believe themselves to be the true heroes are often
  very impactful villains, it can also be very rewarding to pit your heroes
  against a truly chaotic, unpredictable force of evil. Those who thrive on
  cruelty “just because” can be remarkably memorable.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CRUEL VILLAINS</b></h3>
<p>
  Cruel villains are the ones we love to hate. Each time you think they have
  achieved the height of depravity, they commit another vile act against common
  decency. Cruel villains go beyond what is necessary just to twist the knife
  and make it hurt. When running a cruel villain, think about what actions will
  cause the most turmoil for the adventurers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that it is extremely important to parse the difference between what will
  upset the adventurers in your story, and what will upset the players at your
  table. Be very mindful of yellow and red zones as you run a cruel villain, so
  that you can offend the players’ sensibilities without causing true emotional
  distress.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FANATICAL VILLAINS</b></h3>
<p>
  Fanatical villains pursue a single goal with zealous fervor. Every action they
  take will intentionally bring them closer to their goal. They will not fight
  the heroes out of a grudge, but because it will help them achieve their
  mission. Fanatical villains can often appear deranged or insane as they become
  more and more consumed with their obsession around a particular goal, ideal,
  or outcome.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>INFLUENTIAL VILLAINS</b></h3>
<p>
  Any villain can be influential, but some deal specifically in the impact they
  have on the world around them and the various ways that they can exert
  pressure on different aspects of their society. These villains are often
  politicians, guild masters, or criminal ringleaders. They might hide in plain
  sight or even make their agenda plainly known, but they will have so much
  public influence that the adventurers will find it impossible to touch them.
  Perhaps they fund the city watch or have bottlenecked political power so that
  new laws cannot be passed without their say, allowing them to pull strings
  without doing anything that could cause legal recompense.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MASTERMIND VILLAINS</b></h3>
<p>
  In many ways, mastermind villains are similar to influential villains. While
  influential villains shield themselves with political or economic power,
  mastermind villains are hard to compete with due to their sheer, overpowering
  intellect and capability to plan for any contingency.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Mastermind villains can be difficult to run because they will usually be
  significantly more intelligent than you, the MC, are in real life. To play a
  villain that is smarter than you, you can use a few tricks. Plan for specific
  plot twists that negatively impact your adventurers, but do not plan when you
  will use them. Instead, spring them when they will give the adventurers the
  greatest setback.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Between sessions, you can consider what your adventurers did, and think about
  if the mastermind would have any way of learning this. If so, how might the
  mastermind change their plans? While the mastermind is clever enough to adapt
  to the adventurers in real time, you have the luxury of planning the
  mastermind’s next moves between sessions, which will usually give you a week
  or more to think about how to outmaneuver your players.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If the mastermind has observed the adventurers in combat a few times (either
  directly or indirectly), then when it comes time to fight the adventurers, the
  mastermind will be intimately familiar with their capabilities and can come
  ready with minions, items, or spells that will specifically counter the
  heroes’ capabilities.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Finally, a trick that you can use sparingly is the monologue. If you want to
  make the heroes feel like they have been puppet-mastered by the mastermind all
  along, then think back on your campaign as a whole, and think about the
  actions that the heroes have taken. How might those actions have benefitted
  the mastermind? How can you justify the mastermind secretly orchestrating that
  to happen? While the heroes acted of their own volition in previous sessions,
  you can secretly retcon these events so that they appear to have been the
  mastermind’s diabolical machinations all along.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SYMPATHETIC VILLAINS</b></h3>
<p>
  You might want your villain to be sympathetic. Sympathetic villains can be
  difficult to run, because at the end of the day they will still usually be
  direct antagonists to the heroes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A sympathetic villain might pursue their goal on behalf of someone else. This
  inherent selflessness, even if misguided, will usually make a villain a lot
  more relatable. Also consider qualities that your villain might have that are
  legitimately good qualities, such as lovingly taking care of pets, children,
  or an elderly family member.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To ensure that your villain will not end up siding with the heroes, you can
  also make them a fanatical villain, completely dedicated to pursuing a single
  goal that is diametrically opposed to the heroes’ desires.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>SUPPORTING CAST</b>
</h2>
<p>
  While they do not take the spotlight the way your heroes and villains do, a
  robust supporting cast is essential in any campaign. Remember that NPCs
  (nonplayer characters) are not the protagonists of the story and should not be
  treated as such. Even so, a well-crafted NPC can contribute to the campaign in
  many ways.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Significant NPCs should usually be directly invested in, or impacted by, the
  actions of the heroes and/or the villains. They might have pertinent
  information that the heroes can benefit from learning, or they can provide the
  heroes with useful equipment of mundane or magical variety.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  NPCs might be on their own quests – again, remember that they are not the
  center of the story – and this quest might bring them into repeated contact
  with the adventurers throughout the story.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Like villains, the best NPCs are particularly memorable. They might have a
  tragic backstory that tugs on the heartstrings of the heroes, or they could be
  a flamboyant and comedic character that lightens the mood. NPCs might also
  have mysterious backstories that prompt the heroes to dig more and see what
  they uncover, and of course some NPCs will be instigators or quest-givers that
  approach the adventurers with specific jobs that need done.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  At bare minimum, an NPC will need a name, a description, and a goal or motive
  that they are trying to fulfill. NPCs should also have a basic personality,
  including virtues and flaws. If you want, you can base an NPC’s personality on
  any number of characters from novels or TV to quickly come up with how an NPC
  might act in a given scenario. This bare-bones information will allow you to
  play an NPC authentically, even if you do not know their whole backstory or
  long-term desires.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You can also consider how the NPC fits into the world around them, especially
  if they are in a settled area. Are they prominent among the other folk of
  their town or city? Are they part of a guild, and if so are they loyal to
  their guild or more indifferent about it? How might their alliance help or
  hurt the heroes’ reputations?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Finally, does the NPC’s goals line up more with the goals of the heroes or
  villains? How will the NPC act accordingly?
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><b>VALUES, DRIVES, </b><b>AND QUIRKS</b></b>
</h2>
<p>
  When designing villains and supporting characters, you can use this system to
  flesh them out. Values, Drives, and Quirks will give your characters nuance
  and make them feel alive. This section is also in the <em>Core Rulebook </em
  >to help players flesh out their heroes, although it is a little more in-depth
  in this book.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VALUES</b></h3>
<p>
  People have nuanced and complex beliefs, and at times have beliefs that are at
  odds with one another. To represent this in your character, you can choose
  between two and six values that your character believes in or wrestles with.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Many TTRPGs have made use of the law/chaos and good/evil values systems,
  allowing characters to range from lawful good to chaotic evil. You might find
  it helpful to think of an NPC’s values in the same way but remember that their
  values might change over time, especially when multiple values conflict.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If a character is Logical and Traditional, but is presented with an
  evidence-based logical argument about why a traditional practice may need to
  be amended, you will have to decide which value holds greater import in the
  NPC’s eyes.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VALUES SYSTEMS</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Cautious/Risky. </b>Characters that tend to be more cautious take time to
  plan, weigh their options, and avoid unnecessary risks. They value safety and
  predictability, often choosing the path of least resistance. Risky characters
  thrive on adrenaline and uncertainty. They leap before they look and are
  driven by the thrill of the unknown. Such characters might take the path less
  traveled, not despite its danger, but because of it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Greater Good/Personal Gain.</b> Characters aligned with the greater good
  believe in self-sacrifice and making decisions that benefit the many, even if
  it comes at a personal cost. They seek to uplift society, protect the weak, or
  serve a broader cause. Those leaning towards personal gain prioritize their
  own interests, desires, and ambitions. They act to further their status,
  wealth, or power, even if others might suffer as a result.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Honor/Pragmatism. </b>Characters with a strong sense of honor uphold a
  code, whether it is a knight’s chivalry, a samurai’s bushido, or any personal
  creed. They place integrity and righteousness above all else and will face
  adversity to maintain their principles. Pragmatic characters are adaptable and
  flexible in their approach to morality. While they may have their own set of
  beliefs, they are willing to bend or break their rules if it means achieving a
  desired outcome.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Logical/Emotional. </b>Characters leaning toward the logical end of the
  spectrum tend to make decisions based on facts, data, and rational analysis.
  They are often methodical, valuing reason and objectivity, and may sometimes
  be seen as cold or detached. Characters on the emotional end are driven by
  their feelings, intuition, and personal experiences. They are passionate and
  empathetic and often act on their instincts, even if it means deviating from
  the most reasonable path.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Loyal/Disloyal. </b>Loyal characters hold fast to their promises,
  friendships, and duties. They value trustworthiness and often form deep,
  long-lasting bonds with others. To betray or abandon an ally is unthinkable
  for them. Characters leaning toward disloyalty have a tendency to prioritize
  themselves over any pledged word or bond. They might switch allegiances if it
  suits their needs and see relationships as transactional or temporary.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Tradition/Change.</b> Characters aligned with tradition respect and uphold
  the customs, rituals, and values that have been passed down. They see wisdom
  in the old ways and are resistant to altering established norms. Those
  advocating for change believe in personal evolution, innovation, and the need
  to adapt. They challenge the status quo and seek to usher in new ways of
  thinking and acting.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that Logic and Risk are not mutually exclusive. An alchemist might be
  very logical, but still prone to conducting risky experiments. Likewise, a
  character who is both Cautious and prone to Change might be very intent on
  helping change the status quo of a circumstance, but only if they are certain
  that they can do so with impunity.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>DRIVES</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Virtually every person has some kind of goal. This drive will inform how they
  behave in various situations and might guide NPCs to prioritize certain values
  over others when certain values align more closely with their drive than some
  of their other values. You can roll 1d20 or choose from the following table if
  you want help brainstorming a villain’s or NPC’s drive.

<br />
<p>
  Having selected one or more drives, consider how intense those drives are for
  the character. Does the character care about this drive, but not to the extent
  that they will go out of their way for it? Or conversely, will the character
  betray both their own values and their friends and family if it means
  fulfilling this drive? Most characters will fall somewhere between these two
  extremes. Although there will be exceptions, NPCs will usually be less driven,
  and villains will be very driven.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DRIVE INTENSITY</b></h3>
<p>
  You might find it helpful to track NPC Drives on a drive intensity scale from
  1-10, with 1 being the lowest possible intensity. A character with a 1 cares
  about the drive, but would not necessarily go out of their way to pursue its
  actualization. A 5 means that a Drive is a very motivating factor, and spurs
  many of an NPC’s decisions, but they would not necessarily go against their
  Values in order to fulfill it. A 10 is the most powerful intensity, and means
  the character obsesses over this. Such a character would think nothing of
  betraying not only their allies but their own beliefs in order to pursue this
  drive. For example, a very risk-averse and loyal character with a drive
  intensity that reaches 10 may chase vengeance even if their leader demands
  they do not, and even if the risk is very high.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Some NPCs may have more than one drive, but to keep a character from becoming
  too unwieldy, an NPC should never have more than 12 total drive intensity
  between any number of Drives.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Drive intensity should be variable as a campaign progresses. Events may
  reinforce a drive, causing the drive intensity to go up, or a new drive may
  present itself, taking up some of the available space. For example, a
  character with the Justice drive may witness another act of extreme
  oppression, and this would cause their drive intensity to go from 5 to 6.
  Conversely, a character with a strong Revenge drive intensity may fall in
  love, going from an 8 to a 6 as their Love Drive increases and does not leave
  room for Revenge to fill up so much of their drive intensity. When drive
  intensity reaches 1, a character may let go of a specific drive entirely.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>QUIRKS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  While quirks are usually the least complex part of an NPC, they can make the
  character deeply memorable. An NPC might have a funny voice or a huge love of
  potatoes, for example. The only limit on quirks is your imagination, but a
  short list of example quirks is provided below.

  <b>EXAMPLE NPCS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Here are a few neutral NPCs and a few villains created using the Values,
  Drives, and Quirks system. You can use these as a framework for making your
  own memorable NPCs. Some of these NPCs are less fleshed out, using only a
  couple Values, while others use all six Values and several Drives.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TWO-VALUE CHARACTERS</b></h3>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>AUREYLIA THE SEER</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Greater Good, Emotional</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <span
    ><br />Aureylia is a young oracle driven by visions and her own intuition.
    She often feels the weight of the world on her shoulders and is determined
    to steer events toward the greater good, even if it requires personal
    sacrifice. An MC might play Aureylia as a character who acts impulsively
    based on her feelings or visions, always with the intent to benefit the
    many.</span
  >
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Aureylia would be quick to anger and action and would never sacrifice a friend
  or innocent, even if her actions might cause harm to herself or her long-term
  goals. Aureylia would be quick to trust the players if they tugged at her
  heartstrings, but also be quick to reprimand and even leave the party if they
  made a logical decision that harmed innocents in some way.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MASTER CHEN</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Logical, Traditional</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Master Chen is a venerable monk who has spent decades in a secluded monastery.
  He values the ancient teachings and rituals of his order, approaching problems
  with a calm, analytical mind. An MC might portray Master Chen as a voice of
  wisdom, offering insight based on ancient texts and using meditation to solve
  problems. He may resist new methods or magic, believing in the tried and true.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Master Chen would be amenable to logical arguments. While Master Chen is slow
  to change due to his traditionalism, arguments that are laid out rationally
  and supported with data would overcome his love for the old ways.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SER DAVIN</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Cautious, Loyal</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Ser Davin is a seasoned knight who has fought countless battles for his
  kingdom. Though his valor is unquestioned, Davin tends to avoid unnecessary
  confrontations and prefers diplomacy over direct combat. He is also
  unfailingly loyal to his liege and comrades, putting their welfare above his
  own. An MC might play Davin as someone who advocates for strategic retreats or
  negotiations and is often called upon to mediate disputes within the party. He
  could be resistant to undertake quests that seem treacherous or have unclear
  motives.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Ser Davin would put his allegiances above all, and often urge those who took
  his council to practice caution. He would be slow to trust the heroes, but
  invaluable as an ally once his trust is earned.
</p>
<br />
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TASHA REDBLADE</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Risky, Pragmatic</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Tasha is a swashbuckling pirate captain always in search of the next big
  score. She takes big risks, but always with an eye on the prize. If a plan
  does not work, she is quick to change tactics. An MC might play Tasha as a
  wild card, always pushing the party to seize opportunities and pivot when
  things go awry.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  She might often clash with more cautious or honorable party members. It is
  also entirely likely Tasha might set sail and leave the party stranded on an
  island to chase down a score that sails by if she feels it suits her.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SIX-VALUE CHARACTERS</b></h3>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DARIUS STORMFORGE</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Risky, Greater Good, Pragmatic, Emotional, Disloyal, Change</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Darius is an emotionally driven human warrior. His primary motivation is to
  serve the greater good, even if it means bending or breaking his personal
  code. Having experienced numerous betrayals, he finds it challenging to remain
  loyal. He embraces change, often advocating for new methods and approaches. In
  conflict, he is pragmatic and often takes significant risks.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ELARA MOONSHADOW</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Cautious, Personal Gain, Honorable, Logical, Loyal, Traditional</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Elara is a scholarly elf who values ancient wisdom, loyalty, and tradition.
  She acts out of personal ambition, wanting to elevate herself in the elven
  hierarchy. While she holds a code of honor dear, she always approaches
  situations with caution.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LORD ELARION</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Cautious, Greater Good, Pragmatic, Logical, Disloyal, Change</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Lord Elarion is a calculating revolutionary. Once a prominent scholar, he is
  now a mastermind who is secretly seeking to upend what he believes to be an
  oppressive regime. He believes in a world that works for everyone, not just
  the elite. Every action moves a piece on his vast mental chessboard. He is
  cautious and works through many identities and intermediaries. His true
  identity is a mystery to most. He dreams of a brighter future, but his methods
  are immoral, destructive, and violent. There is nothing Lord Elarion would not
  do to hurt the ruling elite.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  He views himself as a martyr, staining his hands with blood so that those who
  will enjoy the future do not have to. He would call himself a freedom fighter
  and savior, and he would say his drive is freedom and fairness, but his true
  drive is vengeance, whether he would admit it or not.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Drive: </b>Vengeance (Intensity 7)</p>
<br />
<p>
  TRIGGERING EVENT: His firstborn son was killed in a meaningless war declared
  by his king despite Lord Elarion’s counsel. He advised the king not to wage
  war, but his perspective was ignored and his son was lost as a result.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Lord Elarion would be very upset if the heroes accuse him of being oppressive
  or immoral. He believes his vengeful quest to be righteous, even if his
  methods are cruel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  He would likely reassess his antagonistic relationship with the heroes if they
  evoke empathy through familial relationships, especially those of a parent and
  child.
</p>
<br />

        <h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VALUES IN ACTION</b></h4>
        <p>
          Imagine a scenario in which Elara and Darius come across a forgotten
          temple said to contain a relic with immense power. The entrance to the
          temple is adorned with ancient runes that warn of dire consequences
          for those who dare to enter with ill intent. However, they also learn
          from local lore that the relic has the power to heal any wound and can
          even bring the dead back to life. Rumors also suggest that a dark cult
          seeks the relic to perform a ritual that will plunge the land into
          eternal darkness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Elara, being logical and cautious, would first try to gather all
          available information about the temple and the cult. Given her lean
          towards personal gain, she might see the relic as a means to increase
          her standing among her elven peers. Her sense of honor would likely
          make her wary of using the relic improperly and her commitment to
          tradition could mean that she is knowledgeable about ancient protocols
          for approaching such relics. She would probably seek an alliance or
          council with elder elves before making a move.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Darius, driven by his emotional nature and desire to serve the greater
          good, would feel an immediate urgency to prevent the cult from getting
          the relic. His pragmatic approach might lead him to consider
          collaborating with the cult temporarily to understand their
          intentions, only to betray them later. His tendency towards disloyalty
          and risk could result in him storming the temple with a handful of
          allies or even alone if he believes the threat is imminent. He would
          be less concerned with the traditions surrounding the relic and more
          focused on preventing potential catastrophe.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Their shared situation highlights their contrasting motivations and
          approaches. While Elara would act methodically, consulting with others
          and gathering information, Darius would act impulsively, prioritizing
          the immediate threat over potential long-term consequences.

  <b>UNNAMED VILLAINS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The following villains are not as well fleshed out as Lord Elarion, and might
  be useful in jumpstarting your own ideas.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE RELIGIOUS TYRANT</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Risky, Personal Gain, Honor, Emotional, Loyal, Traditional</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The religious tyrant embodies fiery passion and conviction. Such a villain
  values loyalty and expects it from their subordinates. They would rely on
  ancient religious customs, what has worked before, and believe that impulsive
  decisions often lead to strife. The religious tyrant makes decisions based on
  conviction and tradition, not based on calculated outcomes.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE UNPREDICTABLE MERCENARY</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Risky, Personal Gain, Pragmatic, Logical, Disloyal, Change</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The unpredictable mercenary will always pick the winning side, and switch
  sides without batting an eye. They will often make what appear to be grand
  elaborate (and often risky) gestures, but there is a method to their madness.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE GUARDIAN</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Cautious, Greater Good, Honorable, Emotional, Loyal, Traditional</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Bound by oath, the guardian places their sworn responsibility above all else.
  Perhaps they are protecting an ancient secret. They would give their life to
  uphold their charge and would be unwavering in the face of diplomacy and
  threat of force alike.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE AMBITIOUS INNOVATOR</b></h4>
<p>
  <em>Logical, Personal Gain, Disloyal, Change, Pragmatic, Risky</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The ambitious innovator is a visionary, always on the cusp of the next
  groundbreaking discovery. Obsessed with progress and personal glory, they
  often skirt ethical boundaries in their experiments. Many admire their genius,
  but their ruthless ambition and disregard for consequences make them a force
  to be reckoned with.
</p>
