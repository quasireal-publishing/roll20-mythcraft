  <b>Will of the Master. </b>The Furniture Golem may only act within a strict

</p>
<h2><b>RESOLUTION</b></h2>
<p>
  The adventure ends when the animosity between Uvior and Mogg is resolved. This
  will happen in one of three ways:
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The party confronts and defeats Uvior</li>
  <li>The party confronts and defeats Mogg</li>
  <li>The party negotiates a peace between them</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The best possible outcome for the heroes is negotiating a peace between Uvior
  and Mogg, <em>and </em>using Greater Restoration on Humphrey the Cleric. Doing
  so will result in the heroes getting the maximum amount of treasure from both
  Uvior and Mogg (see their respective random encounter entries for this
  treasure), and earns them +4 Goodwill whenever they enter a settlement that is
  home to an adventurer who was turned to stone at Uvior’s tragic banquet.
