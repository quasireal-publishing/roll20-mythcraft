<p>
  The
  <em><a href="https://app.roll20.net/compendium/mythcraft/MythCraft%20Creature%20Compendium" target="_blank">Creature Compendium</a> </em>offers you tons of monsters that you can use to terrorize your heroes.
  Sometimes, though, you will want a specific monster or a variation on a
  monster that isn’t quite covered by anything in the
  <em>Creature Compendium</em>. When this is the case, you can use the
  guidelines in this chapter to design your own unique monsters.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>RESKINNING</b></h2>
<p>
  Reskinning is the most valuable tool you have at your disposal. Reskinning is
  the practice of using the mechanics of one monster or spell, but describing it
  to your players as though an entirely different creature is fighting them.
  This is an easy way to save yourself some time when prepping a combat. If your
  party is attacked by dashing highwaymen, you might use the Knight stat block
  instead of the Bandit stat block, as the stats for Knight better reflect your
  vision of what a highwayman should be.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>TWEAKING</b></h3>
<p>
  You can also make small modifications to a monster’s stat block to help reskin
  a little more effectively. Maybe you want an NPC that knows the Fireball spell
  to do toxic damage instead of fire, or you want to use a Large creature’s stat
  block as though it were a Medium creature.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  For example, a loud, brawny pirate that gets into bar fights and has a
  terrifying reputation might simply use the stats of a Grash. Decrease his Size
  to Medium, and increase his INT and CHA to 0 or 1 (adjusting LOG and WILL
  accordingly). Then describe his climb speed as his skill around rigging, and
  describe his beak and claw attacks as cutlasses and daggers instead. The
  Grash’s screech ability might instead be a fearsome bellow that strikes fear
  into the hearts of all who hear it. By making a couple very small mechanical
  changes, you have turned a Grash into a pirate.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  When reskinning and tweaking a monster, you may overlook a few mechanics that
  arise in the middle of a combat. If a hero tries to disarm the pirate in the
  example by knocking their cutlass away, this technically would not be possible
  because the Grash’s claws and beak are natural weapons. Logically, though, one
  should be able to disarm a pirate of their cutlass. It’s fine to make such
  rulings in the spur of the moment as it makes sense for the story and
  situation.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>CUSTOMIZING NPCS</b></h2>
<p>
  NPCs are some of the easiest creatures to customize. Because NPCs are
  humanoid, they might undergo some of the same training that your heroes do.
  Think about the process of creating a hero: you pick a lineage, assign
  attributes, choose BOP, and gain a talent. You can use any or all of these
  steps to customize an NPC. For example, you might make a captain of the guard
  by taking the Guard stat block, giving them the plains elf lineage, making
  them a born warrior with the guard profession, and giving them one or two
  talents in the warrior class. This will make that particular guard a bit
  stronger than your average guard and will impact their fighting style, which
  can make the NPC seem like an entirely unique creature even if at its base
  level it is just a modified Guard.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  You can also easily change an NPC’s equipment or even give them magic items,
  but be careful when you do so. If the NPC gets into a lethal confrontation
  with the heroes, then the heroes will undoubtedly take any magic items that
  the NPC possessed, so only give the NPC a magic item if you are ready for your
  heroes to use it.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>CUSTOMIZING MONSTERS</b></h2>
<p>
  Customizing a monster can be a little bit more involved than customizing an
  NPC. Here are a handful of tools you can use when changing an existing monster
  to better suit your needs.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MONSTER ARCHETYPES</b></h3>
<p>
  Once you have picked a monster stat block to modify, consider what kind of
  archetype might best describe that monster. Archetypes are not strictly
  mechanical but can help you think about how creatures are represented and how
  you might modify them. Is the monster you’re modifying a low-health, high
  damage assassin? Maybe it summons minions to fight on its behalf.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Having identified what archetype the monster fits, you can remove the features
  that define it as that archetype and give it new features or different HP and
  defenses based on a new archetype that better fits your vision. Changing a
  summoner to a beefcake, for example, would entail removing its ability to
  summon minions and dramatically increasing its HP. You might give a couple of
  its defenses a small boost as well, and give it the Exploit advanced maneuver
  so that it can control the battlefield a little more effectively.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MONSTER TRAITS</b></h3>
<p>
  Many monsters have specific traits that denote certain abilities. Monster
  traits are listed below, and if you want an easy way to customize a monster,
  simply swap out the traits that the stat block already has for new options.
  Changing a Hydra Slime’s Immutable trait to Ethereal dramatically changes the
  way that the monster feels and functions in a fight.
</p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MYTHIC</b></h3>
<p>
  Mythic monsters are incredibly challenging to fight. A Mythic monster has the
  Iron Will and Steel Mind traits. A Mythic monster also is more difficult to
  kill: if it gains the Helpless condition, it is not reduced to 0 HP when it
  takes damage. Instead, all damage that it takes is considered critical.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Finally, Mythic monsters do not roll Initiative, but instead act after every 2
  characters in Initiative order, making them much more capable of devastating a
  battlefield.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MONSTER TAGS</b></h3>
<p>
  Another way to quickly create a custom monster is by mixing and matching
  monster tags. The monster tags are as follows:
</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Mundane: </b>beast, humanoid, monstrosity, plant</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Planar: </b>avadri, celestial, eldritch, elemental, fae, fiend</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Magical: </b>arcane, divine, occult, primal, psionic</p>
<br/>
<p>
<b>Modifying: </b>abominable, constructed, giant, shapechanger, swarm, undead
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  By giving a monster a different tag, it will interact with some of your
  heroes’ abilities differently (such as the cleric’s Sense Planar ability). You
  can also look at other monsters in the <em>Creature Compendium</em> that do
  have that tag and apply their features to your monster.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  For example, if you want to make a biotechnical avadri steed, you might take
  the stats of a warhorse to start. Change its tag from beast to avadri. Then,
  look at some similar creatures that have the avadri tag, like the trench
  abomination. Maybe you want to give your warhorse a similar Rapid Mutation
  table or the Electric Skin feature.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MCMM</b></h2>
<p>
  MythCraft Monster Math (MCMM) is the formula that the designers used when
  creating official monsters for the game. You can use the following tables when
  creating a monster from scratch, or when checking your redesigned monster
  against the balance of the monsters in the <em>Creature Compendium</em>. A
  monster’s typical HP, attributes, simulated AP, and approximate damage per
  round (DPR) are listed by ML.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Note that these are only benchmarks, not hard and fast rules. Remember a
  creature’s archetype: a monster that functions as an assassin will have lower
  max HP and higher DPR than the average for its ML.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>ML</b></h3>
<p>
  ML, or Monster Level, represents how powerful a monster is. You use this to
  calculate the balance of a combat encounter.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>TOTAL STATS</b></h3>
<p>
  A monster’s total stats is the sum of their STR, DEX, END, AWR, INT, and CHA.
  For example, a creature with ML 3 might have 2 STR, 0 DEX, 0 END, 3 AWR, 0
  INT, and 2 CHA. Like heroes, creatures can have up to a -3 in a stat, and this
  is especially common among beasts, who typically have -2 or -3 INT.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MAX STAT</b></h3>
<p>
  A monster’s max stat is the cap on how high a single stat can be. A creature
  with ML 3 typically would not have more than a +3 in a single stat, while a
  creature of ML 16 might have as high as a +6. Monsters of specific archetypes
  might break this rule, but this is uncommon.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>HP</b></h3>
<p>
  A monster’s HP is the recommended maximum HP that a creature of a certain ML
  would have. This is easy to scale up or down based on how long you want a
  monster to live.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Minions should have very low maximum HP, while beefcakes might have more HP
  than their corresponding ML recommends.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>AP SIMULATED</b></h3>
<p>
  AP Simulated is the number of Action Points that the monster is assumed to
  have. MCs do not track AP for monsters, as it would be very time consuming to
  attempt this for multiple NPCs and would cause no shortage of headaches.
  Instead, use the AP Sim’d column to convert AP into Monster Actions.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>ARMOR</b></h3>
<p>
  This is the recommended value of a creature’s AR based on their ML. Tough
  creatures or humanoids wearing heavy armor might have a higher AR, but this
  should usually come with some kind of tradeoff, such as a lower number of
  total stats, reduced speed, or a lower DPR.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b></b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>ATTACK BONUS</b></h3>
<p>
  A monster’s recommended attack bonus will correspond to their max stat. A
  monster that mainly fights with DEX will have the highest possible DEX that it
  can at that ML, for example.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>DPR</b></h3>
<p>
  DPR, or Damage Per Round, is the amount of damage a monster could do if it
  attacked as many times as it could on its turn and hit each time, dealing
  average damage. A soldier of ML 0.5 might have a STR of 2, dealing an average
  of 5 (1d6+2) damage with its shortsword and being able to attack only once per
  round. A highly trained soldier of ML 6 might have a STR of 3 and have the
  ability to attack twice on each of their turns, dealing 6 (1d6+3) damage with
  each hit. Assassins will obviously deal more damage, and beefcakes,
  controllers, and summoners will usually deal a little less.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69);"><b>MONSTER ACTIONS</b></h2>
<p>
  Monster actions allow monsters to simulate using AP. Monsters of higher ML
  will have more monster actions and/or their monster actions will be capable of
  doing more. You can use the following table as a guiding principle when
  figuring out how many AP a monster action should simulate costing.
</p>
<br/>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Type of Action</b></td>
<td><b>AP</b></td>
<td><b>Damage</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Move</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Light Ability</td>
<td>2-3</td>
<td>1d6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium Ability</td>
<td>4-6</td>
<td>2d6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strong Ability</td>
<td>8-10</td>
<td>4d6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Powerful Ability</td>
<td>12+</td>
<td>10d6+</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p>
  Using this formula, you can extrapolate out to 18 AP, although monsters that
  simulate this many AP are exceedingly rare.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Of course, some abilities will deal damage and others will have entirely
  different effects. This is simply a frame of reference that you can use as a
  quick litmus test to ensure that your monster’s abilities are reasonably
  balanced. You can use the following table to determine how many types of
  actions a monster should be able to take based on the number of AP simulated.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  On the following table, moving is also considered a light ability, so if a
  monster can use a light action or ability, they could choose to spend it
  moving.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Finally, note that some monsters might have enough simulated AP for a strong
  or powerful ability, but this does not mean that they have to possess such an
  ability. Many AP might simply let the monster use light abilities much more
  rapidly. It all depends on the feeling you want to evoke when your heroes
  fight the monster. A nimble halfling rogue might have many light actions,
  while a heavyset trollkin berzerker might have only a couple actions that pack
  a stronger punch.
