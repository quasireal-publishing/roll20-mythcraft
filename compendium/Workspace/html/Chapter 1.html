  Many are the responsibilities of the MythCrafter (MC). As rules referee, main
  villain, a whole host of supporting characters,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>the
  adventuring party’s number one fan, you have many roles to fill. MCing can be
  a tremendously rewarding experience, but it also takes significantly more
  preparation than simply playing the game.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Whether you are new to MCing or you have been running TTRPGs for years, it can
  be helpful to skim through this chapter. This chapter helps you consider what
  kind of game you want to run, best practices for managing your players, and
  offers a guide to getting the most out of this book.

<p>
  A tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) is, in the broadest sense, a
  collaborative storytelling game. One player (the MC) will present scenarios to
  the other players (the adventurers), and together the adventurers will work as
  a team to complete the quests that the MC offers them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  TTRPGs share some roots with improv acting as you are collectively telling a
  story together. However, when the outcome of an action is uncertain, you
  determine success by rolling dice and adding your character’s skills or
  abilities to those die rolls.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A game of MythCraft will typically be played over many sessions, much like a
  narrative video game. As the heroes grow in power, they will explore more of
  the world and face bigger threats, cementing their legacies in the annals of
  history.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This book is designed to make MCing as easy as possible. It provides many tips
  for running a good game session with your friends, designing memorable
  campaigns, and customizing nonplayer characters (NPCs) and monsters. It also
  offers plenty of plot hooks to help you get your ideas flowing. The last two
  chapters of this book also include detailed lore on one of the continents of
  Ancerra (the first official world setting of MythCraft) and a fully fleshed
  out adventure for low-level heroes that you can use to get your campaign
  started or test out the system.

  <b
    >SESSION
    ZERO</b
  >
</h2>
<p>
  Colloquially known as “Session Zero,” it is highly advised to take some time
  and have a conversation with your group of players before playing the game.
  This could be the entire first game session that you get together as you
  embark on a long campaign, or it could be the first 5 or 10 minutes of a
  single session game, also known as a one-shot.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The purpose of a Session Zero conversation is to ensure that both you as the
  MC and all of your individual players are more or less on the same page with
  game expectations and general interpersonal etiquette.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that in a long campaign, it can be helpful to
  have&nbsp;<em>multiple&nbsp;</em>Session Zero style conversations, typically
  between adventure arcs. Checking in and ensuring that everyone is having fun –
  or, if they are not, what changes might be made – can help ensure the
  long-term health of an extended campaign.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A few suggestions for Session Zero discussion topics are provided below.
</p>
<h3><b>GAME EXPECTATIONS</b></h3>
<p>
  What are players committing to by joining your campaign? Here are a few
  considerations:
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Campaign Length:&nbsp;</b>Roughly how long do you expect your campaign to
  last? Is this a one-shot that will be done at the end of the night, or a short
  campaign that will span a half-dozen sessions, or a multi-year saga?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Player Absences:&nbsp;</b>Schedules get tricky, and sometimes it is
  impossible to get everyone together. Do you still play if you are missing one
  player? What about two? If you cancel a session, do you call the night off
  entirely or do you play an interlude-style one-shot set elsewhere in the
  world? Maybe it is time to break out a dusty board game and pick up your
  MythCraft campaign once you can get more of the party together.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Characters when a Player is Absent:&nbsp;</b>If you play a session and one
  of the players is missing, what happens to their character? It can be
  difficult to narratively justify the character being absent, so does another
  player want to temporarily handle both their own adventurer and the adventurer
  of the missing player? Or perhaps your table would rather ignore realism for
  the sake of simplicity, and rule that if a player is absent, their adventurer
  is also absent.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Player Responsibilities:&nbsp;</b>Because the MC does significantly more
  preparatory work before each game, it only makes sense to delegate certain
  responsibilities to your players. This might include coordinating snacks and
  dinners, managing a game schedule, or taking care of certain bookkeeping
  responsibilities like the group’s treasure hoard or tracking Initiative.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Adventurer Code of Conduct:&nbsp;</b>In most TTRPGs, adventurers must work
  together to accomplish a common goal. This does not mean that they must always
  get along with one another; some of the most memorable adventures contain
  heroes that hold significant moral and strategic disagreements with one
  another. It is important, however, to make sure everyone understands that this
  is a cooperative game. A sneaky pickpocket should generally consider the other
  players’ adventurers to be off-limits for thieving. If an adventurer feels
  very strongly about not pursuing a course of action, but the rest of the party
  is determined to proceed, then that player should be encouraged to come up
  with a justification – even a flimsy one – for why their adventurer would
  reluctantly continue traveling with their friends. Be sure to determine ahead
  of time whether PVP (player vs player) combat is allowed under any
  circumstances.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Real-Life Conflict:</b>&nbsp;Conflicts that arise in the confines of a
  shared fictional story should never spill into the real world, and likewise,
  conflicts that you may have with your friends in the real world should not
  bleed into the game. Especially as an MC, do not act punitively by punishing a
  player’s character within your narrative as a way of retaliating due to
  outside circumstances. Resolve outside conflict maturely. Usually this may
  warrant a one-on-one conversation, but on occasion it might be better to
  handle a conflict by talking through it respectfully as a whole group. Always
  strive to hear the other person’s opinions in good faith; it is often safe to
  assume that someone is not intentionally causing real-world conflict and also
  wants to resolve the conflict as badly as you do.
</p>
<h3><b>SETTING THE TONE</b></h3>
<p>
  Having established the expectations for the game, it is also a good idea to
  establish the tone that you are aiming for in your campaign.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Fantasy adventures cover a massive range of tones, from&nbsp;<em
    >Monty Python and the Holy Grail&nbsp;</em
  >to&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>. Determine what kind of story you want to
  tell, and converse with your players to come to an accord. Is this a comedic
  adventure or a grimdark murderfest? How likely are adventurers to die? Is it
  likely for their actions to have severe consequences? If they murder a town
  guard, will this come back to haunt them, or will it typically be hand-waved?
  Are offbeat puns encouraged? What about joke characters like Sir McGuffin of
  Plotsburg and Herring the Red?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that even if you choose a specific tone for your game, you can still
  incorporate other tones. Dark campaigns cannot be broody and grim all the
  time; the adventurers will need moments of levity, hope, and redemption to
  remind them why they fight in the first place. Similarly, games that are
  primarily comedic can be a great place to explore some heavy themes, like
  corrupt power and influence.
</p>
<h3><b>YELLOW AND RED ZONES</b></h3>
<p>
  Finally, it is strongly advised that you discuss “Yellow and Red Zones” with
  your players. Yellow zones are things that players do not feel very
  comfortable with in the campaign, but will tolerate. Generally, if you
  consider including something that falls within a player’s yellow zone, it
  might be a good idea to consult with them first. An example of a yellow zone
  topic might be something as simple as arachnophobia, or something heavier like
  extramarital affairs. Red zones are things that players want completely barred
  from your game that should not be on the table at any point during gameplay.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Having had conversations with your players about game expectations, the tone
  of the campaign, and yellow and red zone topics to be observed, it is time to
  dive in and begin designing your first MythCraft campaign!
</p>
<h3><b>PREPARING FOR A SESSION</b></h3>
<p>
  As you prepare a game session, it is helpful to have a few goals in mind. Your
  players will undoubtedly take the session in directions that you did not
  anticipate, and it is okay if you do not achieve every narrative goal that you
  set out to meet in a game session.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Ideally, each session will spotlight each hero at least once and will advance
  the story’s narrative in one notable way.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Spotlighting a hero will look different for each player’s character. Imagine a
  party of heroes is traveling across a harsh desert. The ranger might manage to
  find enough food for the party despite the hostile environment. The troubadour
  might talk down or even befriend some would-be bandits. The berzerker could
  take on a ferocious desert monster in spectacular fashion. While each of these
  three heroes might contribute to solving each dilemma, by emphasizing their
  strengths in narration you can make each player feel especially proud of their
  unique contributions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A notable narrative moment might be an NPC revealing information to the party
  which will allow them to get into the forbidden crypt. They might confront the
  final boss of an adventure, or complete a side quest for a friendly barkeep.
  Not every narrative moment has to be monumental, but it is good to advance the
  plot in some small way every time you play.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  In addition to these narrative considerations, spend some time thinking about
  what the party has done so far and what you think they might do next. Plan out
  a couple combat encounters, a couple social encounters, and a couple
  exploration encounters accordingly. Having two or three encounters of each
  type on hand will help you quickly respond to the decisions that your players
  make.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Guides for designing such encounters can be found in the following chapters.
