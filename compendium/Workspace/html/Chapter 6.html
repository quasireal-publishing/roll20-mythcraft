<p>
  The world of adventure is rife with far more dangers than direct
  person-to-person battle. You might face an engine of war, such as a trebuchet.
  Terrible blows might break bone or spirit, leaving you to contend with a
  lengthy recovery. Poisons and diseases lurk in moldering dungeons, cursed
  crypts, and even stinking alleys. Devious villains might even implement such
  maladies as weapons in their arsenal.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This chapter offers a few examples of siege equipment, lingering injuries,
  poisons and diseases, and insanity. You can use these as a frame of reference
  for creating your own.
</p>
<h2><b>Structure Health</b></h2>
<p>
  The durability of structures, such as bridges, houses, and castles, may come
  into play at some point on an epic quest, especially in a siege scenario. When
  determining the HP, armor rating (AR), and the damage threshold (DT) of a
  structure, use the following table as a guideline. Take into account the
  specific circumstances of your region. If a castle wall has eroded under high
  winds or heavy downpours for years already, then consider lowering any of its
  stats to account for this. Conversely, if a bridge is magically reinforced,
  then it might have a higher Resist against physical damage or might be Immune
  to nonmagical damage.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Structural integrity should typically be tracked in 10 ft by 10 ft panels. As
  the MC, it is your job to rule how the destruction of a portion of a structure
  impacts the rest of the structure. Knocking a 10 ft square hole in the side of
  a stone wall might cause the wall above it to crumble, or the wall portion
  above the hole might remain in place, held firm by the intact walls on either
  side.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that any damage reduction (DR) is applied after determining DT. All
  inanimate materials are Immune to psychic damage.
</p>
<h2><b>Damage Reduction (DR)</b></h2>
<p>
  If a creature or structure has Damage Reduction (DR) X, they subtract their DR
  number from all damage they take, unless they are Vulnerable to the type of
  damage that they are taking. If damage specifies that it ignores Resist, it
  also ignores DR. The DR number may be followed by a weapon tag, magic source,
  or damage type. This means that creature takes full damage from a weapon with
  that tag or damage type.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example, a creature with DR 5/Fire would take full damage from fire, and
  subtract 5 from all other sources of damage. A creature with DR 15/Silvered
  would take full damage from silvered weapons, and subtract 15 from all other
  damage.
</p>
<h2><b>Damage Threshold (DT)</b></h2>
<p>
  Damage Threshold (DT) is a very rare defense that is typically seen on
  structures and vehicles. DT determines how much damage a creature must deal at
  once to deal any damage at all.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example, if a stone wall has DT 15, and a player deals 14 damage to it, it
  instead takes 0. If a player deals 16 damage, conversely, then the stone wall
  takes all 16 damage because its DT 15 was overcome.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For the purposes of overcoming DT, “damage dealt at once” is determined by a
  single expenditure of AP. Each expenditure of AP for an attack is a new roll
  against DT; you cannot stack attacks to overcome DT.. For the purposes of
  overcoming DT, “damage dealt at once” is determined by a single expenditure of
  AP. Each expenditure of AP for an attack is a new roll against DT; you cannot
  stack attacks to overcome DT.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example: A spell deals multiple damage sources, such as 2d8 fire damage
  and 2d8 blunt damage. Since that spell is one expenditure of AP, add them
  together to determine if it overcomes DT. A player makes two maul attacks
  against a stone wall on the same turn. Because these are two expenditures of
  AP, do not add the damage together from the two attacks to determine if they
  overcome DT.

<h2><b>SIEGE EQUIPMENT</b></h2>
<p>
  Castles and fortified towns are usually well-defended, and arrows might not
  suffice to penetrate thick stone walls. Whether your heroes purchase and use
  siege equipment or must fight against it, these machines can significantly
  increase the tension in a combat scene.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Siege equipment is a little like the weapons and armor that an adventurer
  might use, but has more intricacies.
</p>
<h3><b>RANGED</b></h3>
<p>
  A typical siege weapon will have the Ranged property, which is functionally
  the same as any weapon’s Ranged property.
</p>
<h3><b>AMMUNITION</b></h3>
<p>
  All nonmagical siege weapons will have the Ammunition tag. Unlike normal
  weapons, a number of AP will be listed immediately after the ammunition type.
  It takes that many AP to load a siege weapon. A siege weapon cannot make a
  ranged attack if it is not loaded.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A siege weapon lists the type of ammunition it uses: a ball or a bolt. A
  standard ball or bolt will deal the damage listed by the weapon, but specialty
  ammunition will have other effects.
</p>
<h3><b>RELOAD</b></h3>
<p>
  Many siege weapons have a Reload feature. After it is fired, a creature must
  spend the appropriate number of AP to set the weapon for usage again,
  whereupon ammunition can be applied.
</p>
<h3><b>AREA OF EFFECT</b></h3>
<p>
  Ammunition fired from a siege weapon generally causes a shockwave of blunt
  force, a hail of sharp blades, or an explosion of fire or other elemental
  energy. The AOE column specifies a radius (from the point of contact) or a
  line or cone (drawn from the siege weapon) to a target point within range. The
  attack is made against every creature in that area.
</p>
<h3><b>HEFT AND SPEED</b></h3>
<p>
  Siege equipment is large and cumbersome. A Heft score provides an abstract way
  of measuring the amount of force it takes to move that equipment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When a number of creatures collectively pull or push the equipment, they must
  spend 3 of their AP on a turn to move it. A creature must count as Medium or
  larger for the purposes of lifting, dragging, and carrying to contribute. When
  a creature contributes to moving a siege engine, add its STR to a collective
  pool. At the start of its next turn, the creature removes its STR from the
  pool unless it uses its turn to move the engine again.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If a humanoid counts as Large or larger for the purposes of lifting, dragging,
  and carrying, they can add double their STR.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When the collective pool of STR meets or exceeds ½ of a siege engine’s Heft
  score, the creatures that contributed may move the equipment up to ½ its
  speed; if they achieve a total of equal to or greater than the equipment’s
  Heft, then it moves its total speed. Any creature that contributed to moving
  the equipment immediately moves with it when this occurs.
</p>
<h3><b>HEALTH AND ARMOR</b></h3>
<p>
  Siege equipment has HP, AR, REF, and FORT just like any creature. Most siege
  equipment also has DT or other forms of resistance to damage. It does not have
  ANT, LOG, or WILL, however, and cannot be affected by any ability or attack
  that would target those defenses.
</p>
<h3><b>ATTACK BONUS</b></h3>
<p>
  When making an attack with a siege weapon, choose AWR or INT. For every 3
  points you have in that attribute, add +1 to your attack roll. Additionally,
  for every 4 points you have in the Vehicles* [land] skill, add +1 to your
  attack roll.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This will generally mean that attacks with a siege weapon have much lower
  modifiers than attacks with a normal weapon. This is intentional; siege
  weapons are devastating when used on easy-to-hit targets such as buildings,
  but are not as effective against individual targets. Furthermore, many siege
  weapons still deal half damage even if they miss.
</p>
<h3><b>CRIT FAILS</b></h3>
<p>
  Siege engines are very particular mechanisms and many things can go wrong with
  them. They crit fail on a roll of 1 or 2. When they crit fail, they no longer
  function until they are repaired by a craftsperson with the relevant skill
  set.

<h2><b>SPECIALTY AMMUNITION</b></h2>
<p>
  Besieging armies often bring specialty ammunition on their military
  expeditions, enhancing their siege weapons. Here are some example specialty
  munitions that an army might implement. Siege weapons can only use specialty
  ammunition if the ammunition is categorized as the same type (a ballista
  cannot fire any type of ball, for example).

<h2><b>TRAPS</b></h2>
<p>
  When implemented judiciously, traps can be an excellent way to keep
  adventurers on their toes. Traps come in many forms, and not all traps will
  deal damage. Some might ensnare the heroes or alert the denizens of a dungeon
  to the heroes’ presence, for example.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Traps that do deal damage should typically deal about as much damage as a hero
  might suffer in a combat encounter. This is not a hard and fast rule, however;
  some very well hidden traps might be very difficult to spot, and their damage
  might be lethal.

<p>
  The Overcoming DC does not necessarily represent you disarming the trap. It
  might represent a hero jumping over a gap, discovering a secret door, finding
  the correct lever or keyhole, or figuring out the correct password to bypass
  the danger.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Traps might be triggered in many ways if the Perceiving DC is not met.
  Displacing a door or object might set off a trap mechanism. A
  pressure-sensitive floor plate might have light objects resting on it, giving
  the illusion of safety, but when an average adult humanoid steps on it, their
  weight triggers the trap. Hidden trapdoors and tripwires are common traps that
  are low-effort but highly effective. A false keyhole or misguiding lever might
  look like it will help you progress through the dungeon only to spring a trap
  on you instead. Your imagination is the only limit for designing how traps are
  concealed and how they might be overcome.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  In addition to traditional traps that drop heroes into pits or hit them with
  blades or darts of some kind, consider more unique traps. Poisonous gas,
  explosions, a magical rune that teleports a hero into some kind of prison,
  falling rocks, and a magical monster spawning portal are all unique ideas that
  can make for memorable traps.
</p>
<h2><b>LINGERING INJURIES</b></h2>
<p>
  Sometimes, a hero will sustain a significant injury. A club from a trollkin
  berzerker might crack a rib, or an unfortunate encounter with a swarm of
  bendelexes might leave an adventurer with severe internal bleeding.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Giving a hero a lingering injury can be a meaningful way to remind the heroes
  that they are not immortal, and that sometimes they are not up to the task of
  defeating every monster they encounter. Note, however, that lingering injuries
  can seriously inhibit a hero’s ability to function and should only be used
  sparingly. As a frame of reference, you might considering lingering injuries
  if:
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>A major villain or boss monster crits</li>
  <li>A hero takes damage equal to or greater than ½ their maximum HP</li>
  <li>
    The heroes confront a monster that they have been told is far too powerful
    for them to face
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following table provides example lingering injuries, along with
  INT/Medicine checks that might speed up an injury’s recovery process.

<h2><b>POISON</b></h2>
<p>
  Poisons come in many forms, and might be applied to a weapon, ingested with a
  meal, or breathed in while exploring a deadly dungeon.
</p>
<br />
<p>Poisons are categorized with three types of tags:</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Rarity </b>denotes how common a poison is. Poison will be Common,
    Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, or Mythical.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Lethality </b>denotes how dangerous a poison is. Lower-lethality poisons
    are typically much more common.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Transmissibility </b>denotes how likely the effects of the poison are to
    spread to another target. High transmissibility is very uncommon for
    poisons.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Several abilities might allow you to ignore or treat poisons of a certain
  level of rarity. Lethality and transmissibility are not referenced in the
  <em>Core Rulebook</em>, but will come into play in later releases as the
  peoples of Ancerra become more medically advanced.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Poison stat blocks have three parts: Application, Symptoms, and Treatment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Application </b>explains what must happen for a creature to suffer from the
  poison: is it ingested, breathed, or do you simply touch it?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms </b>breaks down the poison’s symptoms in increments of time.
  Slow-acting poisons might have day-by-day symptomatic progressions, while fast
  acting ones might be minute-by-minute or even round-by-round.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment </b>explains what one must do to become cured of the poison. This
  typically involves some kind of antidote, magical healing, and/or successful
  INT/Medicine checks.
</p>

<h2><b>DISEASE</b></h2>
<p>
  “Disease” is a term used loosely in this context to refer to any sort of
  pathogenic alien entity that enters one’s body. This could technically be a
  disease, infection, or virus, but all three are simply referred to as diseases
  for the purposes of game mechanics.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Diseases are categorized in the same way as poisons, with Rarity, Lethality,
  and Transmissibility. As with poisons, Lethality and Transmissibility are not
  referenced in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, but will come into play in later
  releases.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Disease stat blocks have five parts: Infection, Outbreak, Contagion, Symptoms,
  and Treatment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection </b>explains what must happen for a creature to become infected.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Outbreak </b>is an optional tool that an MC can use when facilitating the
  outbreak of a disease.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Contagion </b>explains how quickly the disease might spread, and how to
  determine whether it spreads to certain heroes or relevant NPCs.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms </b>convey on an hour-by-hour or day-by-day basis what happens to
  an infected creature.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment </b>informs you on the steps you must take to cure a disease.
  This will typically involve making multiple INT/Medicine checks, and certain
  expensive ingredients or magical healing abilities might make this process
  easier or might be required to even attempt this process.
</p>

<h3><b>BEASIAN BOILS</b></h3>
<p><em>Very Rare Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: Medium</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: High</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>A creature gains Beasian Boils when they are hit with a
  <b>Blood Beast</b><b>’s</b> Rip and Tear ability.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Outbreak and Contagion: </b>Beasian Boils spread when Blood Beasts or their
  spawn hit with specific attacks, so creatures only contract this disease
  through combat.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the
  start of each of the following days (after Taking a Rest, if they were able to
  Rest). The effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Day 1: </b>Become Sickened as brown-green boils blister up just beneath
    your skin. Some might burst and ooze fluorescent lime green gunk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 2: </b>You gain Iron Will and Steel Mind as a fog takes hold in your
    brain. You also cannot benefit from the Focused or Rallied conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 3: </b>While in combat, when you are Bloodied, you have Bleeding
    (1d4) as more of your pustules split open. Coarse hair begins sprouting
    along your body.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 4:</b> Make an END check. If you roll above a 17, you gain Fatigue
    and make this roll again on the following day.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you roll below a 17 on or after Day 4, you transform into a Blood Beast
  Spawn. As a Blood Beast Spawn, you have the stats of a <b>Dire Hyena </b>and
  can no longer distinguish ally from enemy. When you hit someone with your Bite
  attack, make a secondary attack: +3 vs FORT. <b>Hit: </b>The creature
  contracts Beasian Boils.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing the Beasian Boils requires one or more INT/Medicine
  checks. Each check must include herbs and bandages soaked in medicinal salves
  mixed with silver shavings. Each application of this medicine costs at least
  80 sc, which the process consumes. You cannot receive more than 1 check per 24
  hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The DC to treat this disease is 17. If you receive treatment within 24 hours
  of being hit, you are cured. Otherwise, you need to receive two successful
  treatments to be cured.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you are a Blood Beast Spawn, Greater Restoration and similar magic can
  remove the disease and restore you to your previous state.
</p>

<h3><b>BOIL PLAGUE</b></h3>
<p><em>Common Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: Low</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: Extreme</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>Boil Plague spreads through physical contact. Creatures that
  suffer Boil Plague break out in running sores whose oils carry infection.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Outbreak: </b>5d20 creatures in an urban area contract Boil Plague.</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Contagion: </b>At the end of each day, Xd20 additional creatures are
  infected, where X equals the number of days since the outbreak. Subtract 1 die
  from this roll (to a minimum of 0d20) for every 20 infected creatures that
  have remained at least partially quarantined for the past 24 hours and have
  received adequate hygienic care (washing the sores, keeping hands clean,
  etc.). If all infected creatures are partially quarantined and receive
  adequate hygienic care, the disease does not spread.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you need to determine whether a specific PC or NPC contracts the disease,
  make an attack against that creature’s FORT. The attack bonus is +1 per 1
  minute the creature has spent in close proximity to one or more infected
  creatures, to a maximum of +20.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms:</b> A creature gains progressively worse symptoms the longer that
  they are infected. Once a creature is infected, they become infectious and can
  spread the disease 1d3 hours later. Once the creature is infectious, then it
  gains the following symptoms at the start of each of the following days. These
  effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Day 1: </b>Shaken</li>
  <li><b>Day 2: </b>Sickened</li>
  <li><b>Day 3: </b>Staggered</li>
  <li><b>Day 4: </b>Remove the Staggered condition</li>
  <li><b>Day 5: </b>Remove the Sickened condition</li>
  <li><b>Day 6:</b> Remove the Shaken condition</li>
  <li><b>Day 7: </b>Creature fully recovers</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Creatures that suffer Boil Plague and recover have nasty pockmarks that rarely
  fade completely, but fade to being barely noticeable after 2d12 months.
  Creatures that suffer Boil Plague and recover become immune to Boil Plague for
  1 year.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Treating a creature with the Boil Plague requires a DC 15
  INT/Medicine check. If you succeed, then the creature’s symptoms rapidly
  progress. Over the next hour, that creature’s symptoms advance by 1d3 days. A
  creature can benefit from this treatment only once while infected with Boil
  Plague.
</p>

<h3><b>DEATHBOIL PLAGUE</b></h3>
<p><em>Rare Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: High</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: Medium</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>Deathboil Plague spreads through physical contact. An
  infected creature’s boils and pustules will frequently burst, making treatment
  a messy process. These burst oils spread rapidly and infect other creatures
  that come into contact with them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Outbreak: </b>5d10 creatures in an urban area contract Deathboil Plague.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Contagion: </b>At the end of each day, Xd10 additional creatures are
  infected, where X equals the number of days since the outbreak. Subtract 1 die
  from this roll (to a minimum of 0d10) for every 10 infected creatures that
  have remained completely quarantined for the past 24 hours. If all infected
  creatures are quarantined, the disease does not spread.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you need to determine whether a specific PC or NPC contracts the disease,
  make an attack against that creature’s FORT. The attack bonus is +1 per 5
  minutes the creature has spent in close proximity to one or more infected
  creatures, to a maximum of +20.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>A creature gains progressively worse symptoms the longer that
  they are infected. Roll 1d3. A creature that is exposed to the disease takes
  that many days to incubate. Once they have incubated, the disease is potent
  and can spread to other creatures. Additionally, once the creature has
  incubated, then it gains the following symptoms at the start of each of the
  following days. These effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Day 1: </b>Shaken.</li>
  <li><b>Day 2: </b>Sickened.</li>
  <li><b>Day 3: </b>Slowed.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Days 4-14: </b>Gain Fatigue. During this period, infected creatures have
    blotches of blackened or otherwise discolored skin.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Days 11-14: </b>If a creature is not cured by day 10 or later, it must
    lose a randomly determined limb in order for the treatment to be successful.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Creatures that suffer Deathboil Plague and recover often have terrible scars
  for the rest of their lives, including divots in their skin where their
  necrosis was carved off of their body.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Treating a creature with the Deathboil Plague requires a DC
  20 INT/Medicine check. If you succeed, then the creature’s symptoms do not
  progress for the day. If you treat the same creature two days in a row and are
  successful both times, then the creature is cured and is immune to Deathboil
  Plague for 1 year.
</p>

<h3><b>DEEPSHROOM POISONING</b></h3>
<p><em>Rare Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: High</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: Low</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>When a creature inhales a <b>Deepshroom Hive’s </b>cloud of
  spores, it becomes infected with Deepshroom Poisoning.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the
  start of each of the following days (after Taking a Rest, if they were able to
  Rest). The effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Day 1: </b>Demoralized.</li>
  <li><b>Day 2: </b>Shaken.</li>
  <li><b>Day 3: </b>Sickened.</li>
  <li><b>Days 4-6: </b>Gain Fatigue.</li>
  <li><b>Day 7: </b>The creature dies.</li>
  <li><b>Day 7+1d4: </b>The creature rises as a <b>Deepshroom Shambler.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing Deepshroom Poisoning requires one or more
  INT/Medicine checks. Each check must include herbs and medicinal salves worth
  at least 30 sc each, which the process consumes. A creature cannot receive
  more than 1 check per 12 hours. When a creature makes this check, note the
  numerical result and add it to any previous checks from this instance of
  Deepshroom Poisoning. When the numerical results reach a cumulative total of
  30, the infection is cured.
</p>

<h3><b>FLESHLING FEVER</b></h3>
<p><em>Rare Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: High</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: Low</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>M’l’ykkri Flesh Swarms and M’l’ykkri Flesh Worms can both
  cause a creature to gain Fleshling Fever.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the
  start of each of the following hours. The effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Hour 1: </b>Demoralized.</li>
  <li><b>Hour 2: </b>Slowed.</li>
  <li><b>Hours 3-12: </b>Gain Fatigue.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Upon Death: </b>Become a <b>M’l’ykkri Fleshling </b>and 2d4
    <b>M’l’ykkri Flesh Worms</b> emerge from the corpse.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing Fleshling Fever requires one or more INT/Medicine
  checks. Each check must include herbs and medicinal salves worth at least 20
  sc each, which the process consumes. A creature cannot receive more than 1
  check per 30 minutes. When a creature makes this check, note the numerical
  result and add it to any previous checks from this instance of Fleshling
  Fever. When the numerical results reach a cumulative total of 75, the
  infection is cured.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When the infection is cured, 2d4 M’l’ykkri Flesh Worms emerge from the healed
  body.
</p>

<h3><b>GIFT OF THE CHOSEN</b></h3>
<p><em>Rare Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: High</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: Medium</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>A creature might contract Gift of the Chosen if exposed to
  another infected individual.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Outbreak: </b>If an outbreak occurs, a ghost ship appears. When 20 or more
  creatures have a form of Chosen Madness in a single settlement of 200 or more
  individuals, roll percentile dice at dusk each night. On a roll of 76-100, a
  ghost appears in port between dusk and dawn each morning. It is crewed by 5d4
  <b>Chosen Crewmates,</b> 1d4 <b>Chosen Boatswains,</b> and 1
  <b>Chosen Captain.</b> While a ghost ship is in the port or the settlement, a
  dense fog covers the whole settlement. This fog persists so long as the ghost
  ship is in port and cannot be removed by magical means. So long as this fog
  persists, creatures looking for the settlement must succeed on a DC 16
  INT/Navigating check in order to find it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Contagion: </b>Any humanoid within 10 ft of an infected individual while
  they have the Insane Babbling symptom or while proselytizing must make a DC 15
  CHA check or gain one Madness symptom from the following table. Anyone who
  reads a scroll or tome infected with Gift of the Chosen must make a DC 18 CHA
  check or immediately become infected and make 3 Chosen Madness table rolls.
</p>
<br />
<p>These tomes and scrolls are common within some cults.</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>24 hours after infection, a creature must roll 1d6 and gain a
  permanent effect from the following Chosen Madness table. This roll must be
  repeated for every additional 24 hours of infection. If a creature rolls an
  effect that it already has, it gains no additional madness for that day.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If a creature gains all six symptoms from the Chosen Madness table, it is
  immediately transformed into a Chosen Crewmate.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>1 - Uncontrollable Weeping/Laughing.</li>
  <li>2 - Terrifying Hallucinations.</li>
  <li>3 - Extreme Paranoia.</li>
  <li>4 - Masochistic.</li>
  <li>5 - Insane Babbling.</li>
  <li>6 - Blissful Delirium.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing Gift of the Chosen requires one or more DC 18
  INT/Religion or INT/Medicine checks. An infected individual needs X successful
  checks, where X equals the number of Chosen Madness symptoms that they suffer
  from. This treatment can be attempted once every 12 hours. Greater Restoration
  and similar magic immediately cures the Gift of the Chosen without additional
  checks, and Lesser Restoration and similar magic counts as two successful
  checks.
</p>

<h3><b>SCARLET SICKNESS</b></h3>
<p><em>Rare Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: High</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: High</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>A creature might contract Scarlet Sickness if an open wound
  is exposed to blood from another creature. Once a creature is infected, their
  blood becomes infectious regardless of if other creatures have open wounds or
  not.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Outbreak: </b>1d4 creatures gain Scarlet Sickness.</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Contagion: </b>At the end of each day, all creatures exposed to Scarlet
  Sickness must make a DC 15 END check. On a fail, a creature gains Scarlet
  Sickness.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>A creature exposed to Scarlet Sickness becomes symptomatic
  and infectious 1d4 hours after contracting the sickness. Once a creature is
  infectious, incubated, then it gains the following symptoms at the start of
  each of the following hours. These effects are cumulative unless noted
  otherwise.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Hour 1: </b>Sickened.</li>
  <li><b>Hour 2: </b>Fatigued.</li>
  <li><b>Hour 3: </b>Bleeding (1d4)</li>
  <li><b>Hour 4: </b>Bleeding (1d6) - this replaces the hour 3 symptom.</li>
  <li><b>Hour 5: </b>Bleeding (1d8) - this replaces the hour 4 symptom.</li>
  <li><b>Hour 6: </b>Bleeding (1d10) - this replaces the hour 5 symptom.</li>
  <li><b>Hour 7: </b>Bleeding (1d12) - this replaces the hour 6 symptom.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Creatures that suffer Scarlet Sickness and recover often have terrible
  laceration scars for the rest of their lives.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Treating a creature with the Scarlet Sickness requires a DC
  25 INT/Medicine check. If you succeed, then the creature’s symptoms do not
  progress for the hour. If you successfully treat the same creature two hours
  in a row, then the creature is cured and is immune to Scarlet Sickness for 6
  months.
</p>

<h3><b>STONEROT</b></h3>
<p><em>Uncommon Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: Low</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: High</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>A creature gains Stonerot when they are hit with a Sickening
  Statue’s Infectious ability.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Outbreak and Contagion: </b>Stonerot only spreads through direct contact,
  so creatures only contract this disease through combat or through failing an
  attribute check.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>An infected creature first undergoes an asymptomatic
  incubation period. Roll 1d6+1; after that many days, the symptoms begin
  appearing. An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the start of
  each of the following days (after Taking a Rest, if they were able to Rest).
  The effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Days 1-3.</b> You are Slowed. Your skin around the area of exposure looks
    hard, cracked, and gritty, like rough rock.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 4-6. </b>You are Frozen. The skin infection spreads and your joints
    stiffen.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Days 7-10. </b>You are Staggered as the infection overtakes most of your
    body.
  </li>
  <li><b>Days 11-13.</b> You are Petrified.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 14.</b> You lose any conscious retention of who you are and become a
    <b>Sickening Statue.</b> You can no longer distinguish friend or foe, you no
    longer need to eat, drink, or sleep, and you lurk and wait for easy prey to
    whom you can spread the disease.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing Stonerot requires one or more INT/Medicine checks.
  Each check must include medicinal salves or holy water worth at least 10 sc
  each, which the process consumes. You cannot receive more than 1 check per 24
  hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When a creature makes this check, note the numerical result and add it to any
  previous checks from this instance of Stonerot. When the numerical results
  reach a cumulative total of 100, the infection is cured. If cured, you regain
  memories of your life prior to becoming a Sickening Statue after 1d4 days.
</p>

<h3><b>Vampirism</b></h3>
<p><em>Uncommon Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: Extreme</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: High</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection:</b> A creature gains Vampirism when they are bitten three times
  in the span of 24 hours by one or more vampires.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Symptoms: An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the start of
  each of the following days. The effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Day 1:</b> Become Demoralized.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 2: </b>You become irritable and lash out at minor provocations (no
    mechanical effect).
  </li>
  <li><b>Days 3 on until Cured:</b> Gain Fatigue.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Upon Death:</b> Become a vampire (see the following “Becoming a Vampire”
    section).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment:</b> Curing Vampirism requires a combination of divine healing
  and herbal concoctions. A creature may only be cured of Vampirism before
  dying; once they die and become a vampire, this is an irreversible condition.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For a creature to be cured of Vampirism, they must be the recipient of the
  Lesser Restoration or Greater Restoration divine ritual. If they received
  Lesser Restoration, then they must also receive two doses of a special potion;
  if they received Greater Restoration, then they only need to receive one dose.
  A creature may not benefit from both Lesser Restoration and Greater
  Restoration for the purposes of overcoming this infection.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The potion consists of a blend of garlic and holy water. After grinding down
  and blending the ingredients, a creature must boil them together and then feed
  them to the infected creature while the liquid is still simmering. This deals
  1d4 fire damage to the creature.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To successfully make the potion, the creature blending together the
  ingredients may make a DC 14 INT check using the Alchemy or Medicine skills. A
  player that makes a compelling case for another skill (such as Arcana,
  Cooking, or Religion) may use it at the MC’s discretion, though using a
  different skill raises the DC to 16.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A creature may only receive one portion of the treatment (Lesser Restoration
  or Greater Restoration, and the potion doses) at a time and must Take a Rest
  between each treatment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Becoming a Vampire:</b> Once a hero becomes a vampire, the hero becomes an
  NPC. An NPC that becomes a vampire gains the stats of a <b>Vampire</b>
  <b>Spawn</b> or <b>Vampire</b> at the MC’s discretion.
</p>

<h3><b>ZOMBIE PLAGUE</b></h3>
<p><em>Uncommon Disease</em></p>
<p><em>Lethality: Extreme</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: High</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Infection: </b>A creature gains Zombie Plague when they are hit with a
  Zombie’s bite attack and the secondary infection attack that comes with it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Outbreak and Contagion: </b>Zombie Plague does not spread through living
  creatures, so has no Outbreak or Contagion rules.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the
  start of each of the following days (after Taking a Rest, if they were able to
  Rest).
</p>
<br />
<p>The effects are cumulative.</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Until Treated: </b>Gain Fatigue twice.</li>
  <li><b>Upon Death: </b>Become a Zombie in 1d4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing the Zombie Plague requires one or more INT/Medicine
  checks. Each check must include herbs and medicinal salves worth at least 20
  sc each, which the process consumes. You cannot receive more than 1 check per
  24 hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When a creature makes this check, note the numerical result and add it to any
  previous checks from this instance of zombie plague. When the numerical
  results reach a cumulative total of 40, the infection is cured.
</p>

<h2><b>INSANITY</b></h2>
<p>
  Beyond the shelter of civilization, untold horror awaits in the dark recesses
  of the wilderness. Sometimes, the blackened alleys of an oppressed city and
  hidden basements of mad scientists hold horrors just as foul. Adventuring
  often brings heroes face to face with terrifying monsters and maddening
  experiences.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When your heroes come face to face with abject terror, you might make them
  roll for insanity. Insanity should primarily change a character’s outlook on
  the world and be a roleplay tool, although the worst effects of insanity will
  also have mechanical detriments attached. Be mindful of your players’ yellow
  and red zones when implementing any of these effects.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Depending on the type of horror that confronts the heroes, you might ask each
  hero to make an AWR, INT, or CHA check. The higher their roll, the more minor
  the insanity effect, and a very high roll might allow a hero to shrug off any
  insanity altogether. The lower the roll, the worse or longer-lasting a hero’s
  insanity will be.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When assigning DCs to the various effects of insanity, you can use this table
  as a quick reference, adjusting the DCs up and down as you feel is appropriate
  for the insanity.
