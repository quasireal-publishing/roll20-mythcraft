  A thick, heavy gun that relies on black powder to propel heavy iron balls at
  high speeds, a cannon is a devastating weapon that can tremendously turn the
  tide of a siege or naval conflict. A beast that can carry three or more
  unwieldy items can drag the cannon by itself when the cannon is mounted on
  wheels. Cannons cost 2,200 sc.

  A creature within 5 ft of the Cannon can spend 3 AP to make a siege weapon
  attack vs the FORT of each target in the radius. This attack suffers a -2
  penalty against Medium or smaller targets. <b>Hit: </b>6d10 blunt and the
  target falls Prone. <b>Miss: </b>½ damage and the target does not fall Prone.
  If the cannonball did not impact a surface (such as targeting a flying
  creature), it does not use its AOE radius and does no damage on a miss.
