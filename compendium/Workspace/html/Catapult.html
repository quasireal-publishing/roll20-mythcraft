  Catapults are heavy contraptions that can launch their payloads at high speeds
  and arching trajectories. While not as powerful as trebuchets, catapults are
  more maneuverable and can be used to launch specialty ammunition over a
  fortified wall. Beasts that can carry five or more unwieldy items can drag a
  catapult if it is mounted on wheels. A team of beasts that can collectively
  carry that many unwieldy items can also move the catapult. Catapults cost
  5,000 sc.

  A creature within 5 ft of the Catapult can spend 2 AP to make a siege weapon
  attack vs the FORT of each target in the radius. This attack suffers a -2
  penalty against Medium or smaller targets. <b>Hit: </b>4d10 blunt and the
  target falls Prone. <b>Miss: </b>½ damage and the target does not fall Prone.
  If the ball did not impact a surface (such as targeting a flying creature), it
  does not use its AOE radius and does no damage on a miss.
