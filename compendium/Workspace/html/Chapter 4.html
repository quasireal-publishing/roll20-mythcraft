<p>
  From grand castle to deep cave, your quests will take you far and wide. Your
  adventurers are likely to explore many settled areas, from a tiny village or
  farming commune to a sprawling megacity. When designing such settlements, you
  can use tools in this chapter as building blocks to construct an area that
  feels real and alive with activity. This chapter provides both guidance and
  open-ended questions to that end. Not only will your heroes brave the nuanced
  complexities of civilization, but their adventures will probably take them
  deep into the rugged wilds. This chapter also contains suggestions and tools
  that you can use when designing the wilderness beyond the confines of society.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DESIGNING A CAMPAIGN WORLD</b></h2>
<p>
  While you do not need to meticulously map out every inch of your campaign
  world, it is a good idea to at least have a world map with a few regions,
  cities, and points of interest. While you can design your campaign world using
  whatever process works best for you, the following steps are usually a good
  frame of reference.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CONTINENTS AND ISLANDS</b></h3>
<p>
  Start by outlining one or more continents in your campaign world. If you plan
  on focusing your campaign on a specific continent, you do not necessarily need
  to flesh out the other continents in more than rudimentary detail.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Islands usually form due to volcanic activity or, barring that, when two
  tectonic plates push together and form a mountain range that eventually juts
  out of the water. Consider how your islands formed, and whether it was due to
  natural or magical activity.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Coastlines are typically smooth in areas with mild weather. Where
  thunderstorms, typhoons, and similar intense weather phenomena are more
  common, erosion usually shapes coastlines into jagged cliffs and fjords.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MOUNTAIN RANGES</b></h3>
<p>
  Sketch out a few mountain ranges on your continents and large islands. In the
  real world, mountain ranges form when two tectonic plates push against one
  another. Your world may have a mix of this natural phenomenon and mountains
  formed by magical means.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>RIVERS AND FRESHWATER</b></h3>
<p>
  Without the aid of magic, rivers always flow to the lowest possible point.
  Often, they flow to the sea, while other times they might flow into a lake.
  Rivers usually start high in a mountain, fueled by melting snow or some kind
  of freshwater spring. In some areas of high magic, rivers might miraculously
  flow uphill.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VEGETATION</b></h3>
<p>
  Areas of heavy rainfall, along with those bordering a river or lake, will
  naturally have more vegetation. These areas typically grow into jungles near
  the equator and forests the farther away from the equator that you get. When
  air currents that carry heavy precipitation hit mountains, they will dump most
  of their rain before making it over the mountains. This means that you can
  easily chart out jungles, forests, grasslands, and deserts based on both where
  rivers and lakes have formed and where mountains will naturally funnel most
  precipitation.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MAJOR CITIES</b></h3>
<p>
  Towns only develop into major cities when they have some significant resource
  that they can levy into economic prosperity. This might be a natural resource,
  such as a quarry, timber, or pastures to grow food and livestock. It might
  also be a strategic resource, such as being located on a key trade route, on a
  defensible hill, or on a prosperous port. The most notable cities will have
  multiple resources that contribute to their success. With this in mind, pencil
  in a few major cities on your world map.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>NATIONS</b></h3>
<p>
  Consider where your major cities are located and think about the natural
  landmarks that might shape national borders. Mountain ranges, rivers, and
  barren deserts often serve as natural borders for nations looking to leverage
  the natural world into defensive assets. Borders do not have to run up
  directly against one another; there might be unclaimed space between nations,
  where bandits and mercenary groups might stake their claim on stretches of
  road.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  What is the relationship between national leaders and their peoples? Given the
  natural and strategic resources that any nation can produce, how does this
  shape its negotiations with its neighbors?
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>WORLDBUILDING QUESTIONS</b></h3>
<p>
  Having developed large swathes of your world, consider the following
  questions.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>How advanced is technology?</li>
  <li>How prevalent is magic?</li>
  <li>How does magic affect technology?</li>
  <li>How dangerous is the natural world?</li>
  <li>How aggressive and how common are monstrous creatures?</li>
  <li>What methods of long-distance transportation are most common?</li>
  <li>
    How does long-distance transportation affect international or intercity
    trade?
  </li>
  <li>What do people eat and where does it come from?</li>
  <li>Where and how do people get fresh water?</li>
  <li>
    Where do basic materials like stone, ore, lumber, and cloth come from?
  </li>
  <li>Does ambient magic shape the world in any way?</li>
  <li>
    Are there points of power where magic is especially strong? If so, how has
    the magic affected that area?
  </li>
  <li>
    Does interplanar travel happen with any regularity? Are there specific
    points in the world where this is more common?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are some points of interest – magical, natural, or artificial – that
    might pique your players’ interest?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>A SETTLED AREA</b></h2>
<p>
  As you map out a settlement or collection of towns in a settled area, start
  with two fundamental questions: why is it here, and how does it survive? Even
  the largest cities once started as small towns. If a town survives, it has a
  reliable source of water, food, and reasonable protection from invasion by
  other settlements or by monsters.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Most towns start on a river or by a lake, though some can originate at the
  crossroads of major trade routes, relying on consistent traffic to meet their
  basic needs. Be sure to include a source of water and a means of acquiring
  food and necessities when designing a settlement.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Also consider the physical environment around your settlement. You would not
  find a town of steep-roofed wooden houses in the middle of a desert, as there
  are no trees of the appropriate size to construct such buildings and no
  snowfall in a desert mitigates the need for sharp angles on rooftops.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Think about the purpose that the area serves for its inhabitants and for its
  nation, if applicable. Why is this area settled? Is it simply a fertile land,
  or is it a point of military strategic importance? Is there a vein of precious
  metal to be mined?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  How close are the various settlements in the region? Do they work together or
  are they rivals to one another? What kind of features mark the countryside?
  Windmills, farmsteads, and the like are examples. Are the roads well
  constructed and are they maintained adequately?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Having considered your settlement’s physical location and how it fulfills its
  basic survival needs, you can now flesh out more information about specific
  aspects of life in this society.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FIVE FACETS</b></h3>
<p>
  When designing a settlement of any size, you can quickly orient yourself by
  considering five facets of life that shape the culture and texture of any
  populated area. Consider an area’s economic, military, political, religious,
  and social capabilities and attitudes. As you read these five facets of life,
  note that they all feed into one another to some extent, as no aspect of life
  is truly isolated from the rest.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />ECONOMIC</b>
</h4>
<p>
  How is the settlement faring from an economic standpoint? Is it
  self-sufficient or does it rely on trade with neighboring areas? If so, how
  heavily does it rely on trade and what would happen if trade partnerships or
  the physical routes connecting towns were disrupted?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Does the settlement encourage innovation and career mobility, or are folk more
  or less constrained to trades that they were born into? Is this due to a
  circumstance of life or due to the political policies enacted by those in
  leadership? Are common goods abundant, or is it hard to reliably find decently
  made products? Is standard gear priced above or below the average (the printed
  cost in the<i>
    <a
      href="https://app.roll20.net/compendium/mythcraft/MythCraft%20Core%20Rulebook"
      target="_blank"
      >Core Rulebook</a
    ></i
  >), and if the prices are higher, is it due to scarcity or monopolism?
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />MILITARY</b>
</h4>
<p>
  Does the settlement have a standing military, a volunteer militia, or some
  other form of protection? If part of a larger nation, do they rely on a
  centralized national army or on hired mercenaries to keep their region safe?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  How inherently dangerous is the region? Whether bandits or monsters or
  something else, are travelers likely to feel safe within a day’s journey from
  the settlement? How does this affect inter-settlement trade patterns?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Does the same entity that protects the town from external threats also police
  it internally? Or are town guards and law enforcement separate legal entities?
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />POLITICAL</b>
</h4>
<p>
  What is the settlement’s governmental system? Is it autonomous, or a smaller
  part of a regional or national government? When considering both local and
  national politics, think about various real-world political systems and which
  ones would apply best to your vision of the settlement. Some of the most
  famous political systems throughout history are provided on the following
  table. You can roll on the table or simply use these ideas as inspiration for
  your own political design.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When considering the politics of a region, it is also important to remember
  that MythCraft is a highly magical system, and magic is generally accepted as
  real and present throughout the world. How prevalent is magic in this society?
  Are enchanted brooms and pans that cook by themselves commonplace, or is there
  a ban or a steep luxury tax on such goods?

<br />
<p>
  Note that many national governments might have multiple governmental systems.
  Feudalism, for example, supposes that the mayors of various towns will defer
  to the nobles who oversee the regions that those towns occupy. The nobles, in
  turn, are usually answerable to a monarch. Thus, one could argue that
  feudalism is a hybrid of federalism, aristocracy, and monarchy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Similarly, a communist society’s redistribution of wealth and resources is
  often overseen by a totalitarian dictator or a body of centralized power such
  as a monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. This ruling power will generally
  keep far more wealth for itself than what it disseminates back to the
  population.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />RELIGIOUS</b>
</h4>
<p>
  What are the pervading religious beliefs in your settlement? Do the citizens
  of the region typically worship a specific pantheon or even a subset of a
  pantheon, such as two or three specific celestials?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Throughout the settlement, is there religious uniformity or are there multiple
  religions, or differing factions within a single religion? Are there atheists
  or agnostics in the settlement? If so, are they able to share their views
  freely or would that cause social contention?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Are outward displays of piety looked upon favorably or with scorn? Is
  attendance of religious services mandatory or only encouraged by the local
  clergy?
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />SOCIAL</b>
</h4>
<p>
  What is a settlement’s social life like? Do they welcome strangers or are they
  wary of them? Do people tend to be at ease or guarded around their fellows?
  Can children play in the streets unsupervised?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  What are some major holidays that the settlement might observe? These could be
  religious in nature, or they might be related to the turning of seasons and
  agricultural practices (such as a planting festival in the spring, and a
  harvest festival in the fall). Holidays might be held to honor influential
  leaders from the past or present day. If the adventurers participate in such a
  holiday, will they observe people enjoying the revelry or making performative
  gestures out of obligation?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  What cultural moments are particularly contentious in this settlement? Perhaps
  rumors of a nearby monster or bandit group has some people on edge, and might
  have other folk excited for some reason.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Along a similar line of thought, does the settlement have any special
  buildings or institutions in which the citizens take special pride? Maybe
  there is an arena or stadium where gladiatorial matches, chariot races, and
  the like are held. Perhaps the settlement has a theatre or a scholarly
  university.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CONSIDER OCCUPATION TAGS</b></h3>
<p>
  If you want to go into a little more detail, you can also use the BOP
  occupation tags as a frame of reference. This will have some overlap with the
  five-facet approach. When creating a small town that your adventurers will
  likely only spend a session or two exploring, the five-facet approach will
  probably be sufficient. When developing cities or populated areas that will
  greatly impact your campaign or if you anticipate the adventurers spending a
  lot of time in such an area, it can be helpful to consider each of these
  aspects in greater detail.<br /><br />
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ACADEMIC</b></h4>
<p>
  What is the typical education level of your settlement? Are most people
  literate, or are scribes considered especially well educated? Is there a
  school or university in your settlement, or do those with an education learn
  from a traveling mentor who occasionally stops in to teach for a month or two
  before moving on? Either way, is education widely available to anyone with the
  time and interest, or is it reserved for the elite? In some settlements,
  perhaps it is even required of people to get some base level of education,
  while in others it is expected that one’s education will simply be through
  apprenticing for a craftsperson.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If your population is generally well educated, how does this affect the
  economic and governing apparatus of your society?
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />ARISTOCRATIC</b>
</h4>
<p>
  The aristocratic tag overlaps a bit with the political facet of society.
  Consider your society’s elite, whether they inherited their titles or are
  simply the elite due to their amassed wealth and influence. The aristocracy in
  any society are rarely a monolith, as they often engage in back-room dealings
  to outmaneuver one another in both influence and enforceable power.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Who are the major players in your society’s aristocracy? If you have a hard
  time coming up with ideas, think about the most powerful individuals that
  correlate to each of the other occupations. Are they considered aristocrats?
  If not, they likely have friends in the aristocracy. What are the goals of
  these specific occupational leaders, and how might this shape the members of
  society’s elite?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  What do the layfolk think of the elites? Are they distrustful, grateful, or
  indifferent? Perhaps they hold a more nuanced mix of opinions on the upper
  echelons of your settlement.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />MERCANTILE</b>
</h4>
<p>
  This occupation tag has considerable overlap with the economic facet of
  society. Additionally, think about whether there are notable competing guilds
  in an area and what their goals are.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Do they simply want to control the market and maximize profits, or do they
  have some other goal? Are merchants able to freelance or are they required to
  register with a guild or with central governing powers?
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />MILITANT</b>
</h4>
<p>
  The militant occupation tag entirely overlaps with the military facet of
  society.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />RELIGIOUS</b>
</h4>
<p>
  The religious occupation tag entirely overlaps with the religious facet of
  society, though depending on your campaign setting you might want to pay
  special attention to conflicting pantheons or religious sects if they will be
  relevant to your story.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />UNDERWORLD</b>
</h4>
<p>
  <span
    >What is the criminal element of your society like? Is crime rampant or
    uncommon? If crime is widespread, are criminals comfortable committing
    crimes in the broad light of day? Are crimes primarily physical like
    stealing and mugging, or less tangible, like white-collar fraud? Either way,
    why is the governing and military presence in your settlement unable to stop
    these acts? Are they bought off, or in on it themselves, or simply too
    poorly funded to adequately prevent crime from flourishing?</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span><br /></span>
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>WANDERING</b></h4>
<p>
  Does the settlement see a lot of travelers? How receptive is it to people from
  beyond their own borders? Do traveling performers, long-distance merchants,
  international healers, and the like experience a warm welcome or a cold
  shoulder when they arrive in your town? Is there an institution to receive
  them, such as an inn or guild hall specifically tailored to long-distance
  travelers?
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FOLLOW EVERY THREAD</b></h2>
<p>
  When building a society in great depth, never shy away from allowing your
  questions to lead to more questions. As you think about how the various facets
  of society and/or occupations interact with one another, you will find unique
  connections between guilds, aristocrats, and public sentiment. This is where
  your settlement really begins to take on a life of its own.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FACTIONS</b></h2>
<p>
  You likely have had several ideas for guilds, criminal organizations, militia
  groups, and similar factions already as you have begun charting out your
  settlement. While your adventurers may not interact directly with each of the
  factions in your settlement, it can be useful to have a few notes prepared
  about each faction. Even if your adventurers do not interact with a guild or
  faction, its activity might impact the adventurers in some way.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FACTION INTERESTS</b></h3>
<p>
  What are the interests of a faction? In other words, what spheres do they
  influence or have a stake in? A historians guild might pursue the means to
  build a museum or hire out archaeologists to recover ancient artifacts. That
  same guild might simultaneously employ researchers to translate ancient texts.
  A thieves guild, by contrast, would seek to avoid being brought to legal
  account while expanding their influence and wealth. A thieves guild might
  publicly present itself as an artisans guild or some other legitimate
  business, helping it to avoid detection from the authorities.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FACTION REPRESENTATIVES</b></h3>
<p>
  Whether a faction is run in authoritarian fashion by a single individual, or
  administered collaboratively by an elected or self-selected council, a faction
  is likely to have one or two public representatives. You can think of these
  individuals as anyone from a notable politician that represents the faction in
  the town hall to a receptionist who knows the ins and outs of a guild’s
  activities. It could be anyone in between so long as they serve as some form
  of intermediary between the faction and the public. Go ahead and flesh out
  these NPCs, as they will likely be the first point of contact if your
  adventurers seek to get in touch with a faction.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FACTION GOALS AND TIMELINES</b></h3>
<p>
  Every faction has a goal. Faction goals can range wildly from altruistic (such
  as securing fair wages for the common folk) to nefarious (such as finding
  enough dirt to indefinitely blackmail the monarch). You can keep track of
  these goals by keeping a progress timeline for any or all of your factions. Do
  not overcomplicate these timelines if this feels intimidating: you do not need
  to think about individual heists that a thieves guild might pull as they
  prepare a larger scam. Rather, you pick one major goal that the faction wants
  to achieve and break it down into three to five major milestones.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Over the course of your campaign or adventure arc, each time your adventurers
  return to the region, consider how much time has passed in your world. In that
  span of time, how many milestones will the faction have realistically
  achieved? If the adventurers were only gone for a week, then it is unlikely
  that the faction’s goals have advanced at all. But if they have been gone for
  a year or more, then the faction might have attained significantly more power
  (or lost it) in comparison to the other guilds in the area.
</p>
<p>
  Note that some extremely noteworthy factions, such as fiend-worshiping
  cultists, might have goals that tremendously change the world if achieved. If
  these factions are central to your campaign, then their goals should be quite
  hard to prevent, but relatively easy to delay.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By continually thwarting a cult’s attempts to gather humanoid sacrifices or
  rare gemstones for rituals, the adventurers can delay that faction’s efforts
  to reach certain milestones in their ongoing attempts to achieve some greater
  goal.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FACTION ADVENTURE HOOKS</b></h3>
<p>
  Factions can be a valuable resource for quickly investing your adventurers in
  the world. The representative of a guild or faction might approach your
  adventurers with a quest in exchange for wealth, access, status, or simply
  membership in their faction. The historians guild might task adventurers with
  going into the Great Chasm to recover lost artifacts, while the artisans guild
  might ask the adventurers to help clean up the guild’s reputation after the
  thieves guild framed them for something.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>SUPPORTING CHARACTERS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  In addition to faction representatives and governing officials, your
  adventurers will meet all manner of supporting characters in a settlement.
  From the barkeep to the general storekeeper to the mysterious potato merchant,
  the pestersome-yet-endearing child to the shady informant, you will quickly
  populate your settlement with numerous characters.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Some MCs prefer to prepare all of their NPCs in great depth, while others are
  more improvisational and feel comfortable making up NPCs on the fly. Whatever
  your methodology, your adventurers are likely to throw you for the loop from
  time to time, and you will find yourself needing to play an NPC that you did
  not prepare. You can use <em>Appendix A</em> to quickly improvise such an NPC.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>RECURRING NPCS</b></h3>
<p>
  Faction representatives, rulers, benefactors, and adversaries are likely to
  show up multiple times throughout an adventure arc, and especially throughout
  an ongoing campaign. Keep note of your adventurers’ interactions with such key
  individuals, as their shared history will inform these characters’ attitudes
  towards the adventuring party.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  An adversary might eventually become so embittered by the heroes that they
  become a fanatical villain, pursuing any means available to bring the heroes
  to shame… or worse. Conversely, if the heroes prove their mettle to a wealthy
  benefactor, then that character might become a powerful ally to the heroes,
  granting them wealth and access to elite society. Whatever the case, allowing
  these relationships to progress at a reasonably steady rate will help your
  world come to life.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE WORLD KEEPS MOVING</b></h2>
<p>
  MythCraft campaigns are specifically designed to span several in-world years,
  or even decades. Allowing your settlements and their inhabitants to age and
  change at a rate commensurate to your campaign’s pace can be tremendously
  rewarding for your players, and is one of your best tools when trying to make
  your world feel immersive.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When your adventurers return to a settlement that they visited some time ago,
  consider what has changed in the interim. If the society has endured months or
  years of hardship, many buildings might be boarded up and in a state of
  disrepair, goods might be more expensive, and the population might have
  thinned out a bit as emigrants seek more prosperous lands. If the settlement
  has flourished, then it might be notably larger than it was when the heroes
  last visited.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Introducing young or elderly NPCs is an especially potent tool for this kind
  of long-term storytelling. The gangly thirteen year old kid that the heroes
  met years ago might now be an apprentice learning a trade. The barkeeper’s
  daughter might now own and manage the inn herself. The elderly herbalist that
  the heroes bought potions from might have since passed away, their practice
  left in the hands of a younger relative or apprentice.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You can achieve this same effect with NPCs of any age by describing the
  deepening of care lines in their face, gray in their hair (or whatever the
  appropriate equivalent given their lineage), and perhaps their shifting
  outlook on life.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When the heroes visit a town, you can also use this kind of descriptive detail
  to plant seeds for future adventure arcs. Perhaps the carpenter’s teenage son
  has temporarily taken over the business because his father has taken ill, or
  is away in another town trying to fix one problem or another. Not only do such
  interactions make your world feel meaningful and alive, but they also propel
  your story forward by giving your adventurers plot points to consider.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Social encounters can be a great place to utilize skill challenges. Social
  encounters lend themselves especially well to tiered success outcomes, given
  that any significant social interaction with a potential friend or enemy can
  have a variety of favorable or punishing outcomes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When preparing for a social encounter, it is helpful to consider the end goals
  of each party involved. What do the adventurers want? What do the relevant
  NPCs or factions want? Even if they are not present in the scene, what do the
  villains want? Can the villains’ influence be felt in some subtle way in the
  interaction, even without them being present? (Note that depending on your
  villains, this is not frequently needed, but can be a helpful question to ask
  yourself anyway while brainstorming.)
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Using any variation of the rules for skill challenges, you can collaboratively
  narrate the social encounter with your players. Depending on how convincing
  they are, they may achieve the best possible outcome in the encounter. They
  may fumble the interaction and leave humiliated and without any help from the
  NPCs, or they may achieve some form of compromise between the two.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>GOODWILL</b></h2>
<p>
  Goodwill is a mechanic that represents how well liked an adventurer is in a
  given settlement. Goodwill can range from -20 to +20, and the higher a hero’s
  goodwill, the better the community receives them. Typically, you track an
  adventurer’s Goodwill number in private, but the player should know how they
  are perceived by the public.

<br />
<p>
  You can track your adventurers’ Goodwill in a handful of different ways. If
  you want to be very granular, use the following table for each town that the
  heroes spend time in. If you do not want to emphasize Goodwill as much in your
  game, then just use the “Overall Goodwill” column and only track your heroes’
  Goodwill in each region or even in each nation, rather than in individual
  towns.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Because MythCraft campaigns typically span several years, tracking Goodwill on
  a granular level can be more rewarding for the adventurers as they see their
  reputations change and (ideally) improve over the course of the story. This is
  especially relevant if you run a campaign rife with political intrigue,
  skulduggery, and villains that wield the soft power of influence as deftly as
  a cutpurse wields a knife. Tracking Goodwill more closely can lead to
  rewarding narratives as your players might become discredited in one area and
  spend an entire adventure arc reestablishing their credibility.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Tracking a hero’s Goodwill across individual occupations will also naturally
  lead to different heroes becoming the face of the party in different
  circumstances.

  /><b><br /><br />LANGUAGES</b>
</h2>
<p>
  MythCraft does not officially track languages, but assumes that any humanoid
  can find some way of accurately communicating very basic ideas and simple
  conversations with other humanoids, either via translator or nonverbal cues.
  If you want to add a little more complexity to your games, you can use one or
  more of the following models for adding languages to your game.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LINEAGE LANGUAGES</b></h3>
<p>
  This model approaches languages through the lens of lineages. Each sapient
  lineage has its own tongue, and there is a common language shared by all. This
  model is usually human-centric, assuming that the human tongue is the common
  language, so you can maintain this trope or invert it and, for example, choose
  that Halfling is the common tongue.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you use this model, then in character creation, each hero gets to know two
  languages: the common tongue and their own lineage language. If a lineage’s
  own tongue is considered the common tongue, then a hero of that lineage knows
  any one additional language of the character’s choice.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p></p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LEARNING LANGUAGES</b></h4>
        <p>
          As an optional rule if you use languages in your game, you might allow
          heroes to learn 1 additional language for every 2 points of INT that
          they have.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Alternatively, you might introduce a special Languages skill with the
          INT and knowledge tags. Heroes could make Languages checks in order to
          decipher the intent of a creature speaking a language that they don’t
          know. Additionally, for every 4 skill points a hero has in this skill,
          you could allow them to learn another language.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If your world has a large number of languages, you might consider
          allowing your heroes to learn another language for every 1 point of
          INT that they have, or for every 2-3 points of the Languages skill, or
          both.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>
  In addition to the languages spoken by individual lineages, you might
  introduce languages associated with the Five Sources of Magic or with the
  various pantheons. You might also introduce languages spoken by humanoid
  creatures in the

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>NATIONAL AND CULTURAL LANGUAGES</b></h3>
<p>
  Separately from or in addition to lineage languages, you might decide to
  introduce languages based on the nations in your world. If you use this
  system, then there is likely no “common” language, but the more economically
  powerful nations have their languages spoken more frequently.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you use both this approach and the lineage languages, consider giving each
  of your heroes fluency in three or four languages to start out, as
  communication might be difficult otherwise.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Instead of presenting each nation as having its own language, you might group
  nations together by approximate cultural similarity and assign regional
  languages using that framework. Typically, the language spoken in such regions
  will be named after the oldest nation from that region. For example, the
  nations described in detail in Chapter 8 are broken down into regional
  languages here.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TRANSLATORS</b></h3>
<p>
  In a campaign with many languages, you might find that it becomes an obstacle
  to moving the plot forward if none of your heroes speak the right language.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You might choose to assume that trustworthy translators can be found in any
  settled area, and only worry about tracking languages when your heroes are in
  the wilderness.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You could also treat translators as powerful politicians. Many diplomats might
  slightly change the meaning or nuance of words as they facilitate a
  conversation between parties that otherwise cannot understand one another.
  Translators that do this might have designs on power or leadership and promote
  their own agendas by manipulating such conversations.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS</b></h2>
<p>
  As your adventurers traverse the world, they might be confronted with any
  number of environments. When designing your world, you might want to use
  environments as they appear in the real world, or you might want to modify the
  environments in some way. Maybe you emphasize the most extreme elements of an
  environment (forests with miles-tall trees, for example) or perhaps you
  introduce a small but significant twist to your ecosystem (such as a region
  where water flows uphill, or a temperate forest that inexplicably thrives in
  the middle of a desert). Interspersing mundane environments with fantastical
  ones can keep your adventurers deeply engaged in the world around them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When describing an environment to your heroes, be sure to engage as many of
  their senses as possible. Do not describe only what they see, but what they
  hear and smell, how the humid air might stick to their skin, and the general
  sense that the environment might evoke in them.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FALLING DAMAGE</b></h3>
<p>Heroes take 1d4 blunt damage for every 10 ft that they fall.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LIGHTING</b></h3>
<p>There are four levels of lighting that have mechanical significance.</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Bright Light </b>means that an area is well-lit and everything in the area
  is plainly visible, as typical in the middle of the day.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Low-Light, </b>also called <b>Dim Light, </b>is a state of illumination
  between bright light and darkness. Intense stormcloud cover, infrequent candle
  light in a castle hall, or the night under a very bright full moon might be
  considered low-light. One’s eyes may play tricks on them while in low-light.
  While in low light, a creature is Concealed from creatures without the ability
  to see in Low-Light.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Darkness</b> is the complete or near-complete absence of light. A typical
  night, an unlit room, and the like are examples of darkness. While in
  darkness, a creature is Unseen from creatures without the ability to see in
  darkness.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Magical Darkness </b>functions as darkness, but mundane light, Darkvision,
  and even some magical light may not function in it.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>AQUATIC</b></h3>
<p>
  On the surface, waves may vary tremendously in height and intensity, from a
  gentle lapping to a devastating onslaught. Deep beneath the waves, enormous
  creatures lurk in the twilit depths. Whether on a freshwater lake or the open
  ocean, the aquatic environment can be quite unforgiving.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Any large body of water can contain enormous aquatic life, and while some such
  life ignores the affairs of smaller creatures, there will invariably be some
  predators in any watery expanse. Krakens and sea serpents can devastate ocean
  vessels, devouring a ship’s crew or leaving them to the ultimate irony: dying
  of thirst in the middle of endless water.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Surface currents can send an inexperienced crew far off course, and in extreme
  cases deep water currents can cause whirlpools large enough to swallow ships
  whole. Furthermore, on the open ocean, there is no physical shelter from
  storms. Waves can tower scores of feet tall, wind can lash harsh enough to
  tear sailors from their rigging, and lightning strikes might split a ship’s
  mast asunder.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>COASTAL</b></h3>
<p>
  The taste of salt in the air, the bitter aroma of rotting seaweed, and the
  shrill cries of gulls pervade coastal environments. Sandy beaches, rocky
  shoals, seaside cliffs, and colorful tidepools are coastal hallmarks.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A coastal environment may seem relatively safe at first glance, but this does
  not mean that danger does not lurk. Rocky shores are subjected to ongoing
  erosion, which can lead to cliffs with unstable handholds or entire boulders
  that split off from their cliff faces to crush whatever lies beneath.
  Saltwater crocodiles and the like might lie waiting in coastal waters. Cannon
  crabs, stonesharks, and flocks of carnivorous seagulls might threaten a hero’s
  life as well.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The coast is directly exposed to the ocean, so tsunamis, hurricanes, and
  severe thunderstorms can be deadly to anyone trying to survive on or near a
  coastline. On small islands, a creature might find that they quickly run out
  of food, forcing them to look elsewhere to survive.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DESERT</b></h3>
<p>
  The searing sun bakes your skin and the stirring sand abrades it, the heat
  shimmers on the horizon as tantalizing facsimiles of water, and all around,
  the air is so dry that you can practically hear it. Sand stretches for endless
  miles, or rocky bluffs and scraggly brush offer a modicum of shelter against
  the elements.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Aside from the obvious threat of dehydration and overexposure to heat, the
  desert can provide a handful of additional threats. Seeking a shady area to
  rest from the relentless sun seems wise, but these areas are often sought out
  by dangerous wildlife such as snakes and scorpions. Especially in open sand
  deserts without much in the way of rocky outcrops, high winds can kick up
  severe sandstorms that are abrasive and blinding.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FOREST</b></h3>
<p>
  The chittering, chirping, and crooning of myriad wildlife dominates most
  forests, except perhaps during the hush of a cold winter. The ground feels
  spongy underfoot as many years worth of pine straw, decaying leaves, and
  mosses and fungi carpet the forest floor. The air is prickly with the scent of
  dirt and vegetable life, and the quiet explorer might spot larger wildlife,
  such as wolves, deer, moose, or bears.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If an adventurer knows what they are doing, the forest can be one of the
  safest habitats to inhabit, but that is not to say it holds no dangers.
  Valleys and rivers can give way to flash floods during heavy rainfall.
  Poisonous berries, stinging nettles, and poison ivy are only a handful of
  flora that can pose a threat in the forest, and wolves, big cats, and bears
  might hunt a hero, especially a solitary one.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>GRASSLAND</b></h3>
<p>
  The breeze rustles through prairie grasses, clouds dot the endless blue sky
  above, and massive herds of grazing animals roam the gentle slopes while
  predators watch crouched among the grass. The grassland environment might be a
  lush, green prairie, the dry, golden savannah, or anything in between.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Like the forest, adventurers will generally find that the grassland holds
  fewer dangers than other environments. Wild canines and some species of big
  cats, like lions and cheetahs, dwell in some grasslands. With little in the
  way of shelter, natural phenomena can be especially punishing in the open
  grassland: thunderstorms in the spring and summer, wildfires in the fall, and
  blizzards in the winter all might pose a threat.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>JUNGLE</b></h3>
<p>
  On the forest floor, the jungle is dark and dank, the light from the sun
  rarely reaching so far to the ground. Fungi, rodents, and snakes roam through
  the mirk. Climbing any of the enormous trees will reveal a colorful, vibrant
  ecosystem among the trees’ thickest branches. All manner of wildlife and
  brightly colored flora bloom along these wide boughs. Still higher, macaws and
  tropical birds croon from the forest’s canopy, soaring high above the denizens
  of the jungle’s floor.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Jungles can be incredibly dangerous environments. Many jungles have monsoon
  seasons with heavy rainfall that causes the forest floor to become entirely
  flooded, pushing land-dwelling creatures onto hills that become islands for
  the season, or into the lower branches of the jungle’s enormous trees. Big
  cats, crocodiles, enormous snakes, angry apes, and predatory birds all pose a
  threat to an adventurer, along with poisonous fruits and toxic fungi. Some
  plants are even carnivorous, luring unsuspecting animals near with a sweet
  smell before devouring them.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MOUNTAIN</b></h3>
<p>
  Tall, rocky foothills give way to soaring mountains that pierce the clouds.
  The stony earth is hard underfoot and the air burns your lungs with each
  breath. A gorgeous view by day and night comes with chill gusts that buffet
  these tremendous heights.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Mountains often blend with other environments. In a temperate climate, a large
  mountain might roughly share characteristics with a grassland or forest for
  several miles, giving way to a more arctic environment at its peak. Desert
  canyons and badlands can share many properties with mountains, though
  creatures that pick their way along a canyon will not suffer the dangers
  associated with a lack of air due to elevation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Mountainous areas have the obvious risk of falling from great cliff faces. A
  traveler would also need to keep on the lookout for rockslides and avalanches,
  and heroes at particularly high elevations will experience shortness of breath
  due to the thinner atmosphere.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SUBTERRANEAN</b></h3>
<p>
  You plunge into darkness so black that you can hear it, the taste of minerals
  coats your tongue, and the plinks of dripping water echo all around you.
  Somewhere, a creature flutters its wings and chitters in its strange way.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Caves can contain many wonders and ancient artifacts, but they are also
  perilous environments. Spelunkers constantly contend with the risk of
  cave-ins, and they must proceed carefully lest they fall down unseen holes.
  Flooding and lava flows can also pose threats to cavern explorers. Sometimes,
  the air itself might be toxic, and adventurers that carelessly venture into
  tight spaces run the risk of asphyxiating themselves, especially if they use
  fire-based torches, which consume oxygen.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SWAMP</b></h3>
<p>
  Swamps are steamy and humid expanses of scummy water, interrupted by small,
  shallow islands of dense overgrowth. Teeming with small creatures, buzzing
  insects, and larger aquatic reptiles, swamps can offer an abundance of natural
  resources, and an abundance of threats.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Swamps are home to vicious predators like alligators, constrictor snakes, and
  flesh-eating fish. Swamp waters are usually murky, making it hard to see how
  deep the water is below you. This offers excellent cover for those predators,
  and also conceals the shallow rocks that might damage or strand your boat.
  Swamps are usually quite humid and are often breeding grounds for
  disease-ridden mosquitoes and other insects carrying potentially deadly
  infection. Some berries and nuts found in swamps might have great healing
  properties, while others are toxic. Quicksand and muskeg can also drown an
  unsuspecting adventurer who thinks that they are safely on solid ground.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TUNDRA</b></h3>
<p>
  The bitter cold seeps into your very bones, the hairs inside your nose freeze
  and bristle, and each breath in your lungs is like a cold knife. The air
  somehow looks sharp and crystalline, and vapor puffs from every exhaled
  breath. A forlorn kind of sigh seems to blanket the hushed white snow.
  Occasional copses of boreal trees dot the rolling white hills, offering
  possible respite from the elements.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Tundras hold the implicit threat of death by freezing, but more dramatic
  dangers dwell within these snow-choked lands as well. In the spring and
  summer, thin ice might break underneath you and trap you in a watery grave. In
  the fall and winter, blizzards threaten to completely disorient you if not
  freeze or bury you outright.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Glaciers can have huge crevasses and boulder-sized chunks of ice might split
  off from a glacier’s face. Hilly and mountainous tundras also pose the risk of
  avalanches. Some predatory animals, such as lynxes and ferocious polar bears,
  make tundras their hunting grounds.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VOLCANIC</b></h3>
<p>
  The acrid smell of heat and minerals drowns out all other senses. A dry sweat
  breaks on your skin as you near a volcano or its lava flows. Smoke and
  particulate matter make every breath taste chalky. Despite the extreme danger
  of an active volcano, volcanic soil can be incredibly beneficial to the nearby
  environment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Lava is so hot that it can cause creatures to burst into flame even before
  they come into direct contact with it. Once a creature has touched lava, it is
  almost certainly dead. Even if one steers well clear of lava flows, volcanic
  environments also pose atmospheric danger. Air thick with sulfur and silicate
  particles can cause permanent damage to a creature’s lungs.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h2>
<p>
  Break up the monotony of a journey by sprinkling points of interest (POIs)
  into your wilderness. These might be ancient ruins, a strange natural
  formation, or the result of magical activity such as a terrain-altering
  ritual. Consider how relevant to the adventure a POI might be, or whether it
  is simply a small detour that has little bearing on the overall story. If the
  latter, design your POI so that it will not take more than half a session for
  your heroes to explore it, so that they can continue to focus on the primary
  adventure. If a POI does have more campaign relevance, this can be a great
  time to foreshadow some of the significant milestones that you anticipate for
  your campaign. If the villains plan to summon a fiend or use powerful ancient
  magic, maybe the heroes find an ancient ruin with pictograms depicting the
  destruction caused by such entities or magics.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TRAVEL PACE</b></h2>
<p>
  When a party travels through a wilderness environment, you may choose to track
  how far they progress each day. If this is not the focus of the campaign, or
  you only want to pay attention to POIs that your adventurers find, it is fine
  to ignore these rules. But if you are running a survival-intensive game or the
  time that it takes to travel between two points is highly relevant to the
  plot, then these rules will help you determine the consequences of traveling
  at various paces.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The type of terrain or environment that your party is navigating might also
  affect their travel pace. The miles on the following table assume relatively
  straightforward travel conditions: little to no precipitation on flat, firm
  ground or shallow hills, such as those you would find in a grassland or a
  scrubby desert.

  Some weather conditions, such as blizzards, also threaten to give adventurers

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>EXTREME COLD</b></h3>
<p>
  When you are exposed to below-freezing temperatures for more than 1 hour
  without the appropriate clothing, you must make an END check. You must make
  this check once every 4 hours if you are wearing clothing suited to extremely
  cold weather. If you fail the check, you suffer Fatigue.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The DC begins at 6, and increases by 1 for every subsequent check that you
  make against extreme cold. The DC resets when you Take a Rest in an area
  sheltered from extreme cold.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If your clothes are not waterproof and are wet, you automatically fail this
  check.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>EXTREME HEAT</b></h3>
<p>
  When you are exposed to extremely hot temperatures for more than 2 hours, you
  must make an END check. Extremely hot temperatures are in excess of 100 °F, or
  above 85 °F with more than 75% humidity.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The DC begins at 10, and increases by 2 for every 5°F above 100 °F (or above
  85 °F if humidity exceeds 75%).

<p>
  If you drink at least 8 cups of water in the span of those 2 hours, reduce the
  DC by 5.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>EXTREME ELEVATION</b></h3>
<p>
  When you are more than 10,000 ft above sea level, you gain the Shaken
  condition. When you are more than 20,000 ft above sea level, you also gain the
  Sickened condition. For every 4 hours that you spend Sickened in this way, you
  must make a DC 12 END check, gaining Fatigue if you fail.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Prolonged training and ongoing exposure to such heights can mitigate these
  conditions.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>EXTREME PRESSURE</b></h3>
<p>
  When you are deep below sea level in the ocean, the tremendous water pressure
  is enough to cause you serious damage. At 150 ft below sea level, you gain the
  Shaken condition. At 400 ft below sea level, you also gain the Sickened
  condition. For every hour you spend Sickened in this way, you must make a DC
  16 END check, gaining Fatigue if you fail.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that some lineages might be naturally adapted to surviving in such
  depths, and prolonged training can mitigate the worst of these conditions even
  if you are not naturally adapted to such environments.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>RANDOM ENCOUNTERS</b></h2>
<p>
  When designing tracts of wilderness for exploration, you might prepare a
  couple encounters ahead of time and present them to your party. You might also
  think up several different possible encounters and leave it to a die roll to
  determine when such encounters occur.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that not all encounters must be combat encounters. Having to navigate a
  flooded river, negotiate with a trapper, survive a blizzard, and use magic to
  communicate with curious forest critters could all be considered encounters.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When designing a random encounter table, consider how dangerous you want a
  stretch of wilderness to be. If the adventurers are in a relatively safe
  environment, you might use a weighted table or a bell curve table to make
  non-threatening encounters more likely. If they are in an area rife with
  danger, you might use an unweighted table, or even reverse the likelihoods of
  dangerous and nonthreatening encounters on a weighted or bell curve table.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Here are some example random encounter tables using a handful of environments.

<p>
  If your heroes are exploring a generic environment and you do not know how to
  set the DCs for skill checks, you can use the following table as an
  approximation. Adjust the DCs up or down based on your perception of the
  environment; mundane deserts, forests, and other habitats all vary wildly in
  terms of how survivable they are and the numbers provided are simply rough
  benchmarks.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Adventures often take place in “hybrid” environments. Mangrove forests, for
  example, are a blend of the coastal and swamp environment, and badlands would
  be a blend of the desert and mountains. When your heroes are in a hybrid
  environment, use the DCs for either base environment as you deem appropriate.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SKILL CHALLENGES</b></h2>
<p>
  When one of your players attempts something that has a chance of failure, ask
  them for an attribute check to determine their level of success.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Ask for one of seven attribute checks: STR, DEX, END, AWR, INT, CHA, or LUCK.
  These correspond to the seven attributes of the same name (note that there are
  not COR checks).
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To make an attribute check, your player will roll 1d20 and add their Attribute
  Points from the relevant attribute.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Encourage players to mention if they have a relevant skill. This would allow
  them to make their check with an added bonus.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For example, assume that Marcus is level 1. If the MC asks Marcus to make a
  Charisma roll to convince a local official to offer aid, then Marcus would
  roll 1d20 + his CHA, or 1d20+2. However, Marcus also has +3 in the Persuading
  skill, so he could remind the MC of this and make the roll at +5 instead: +2
  from his Charisma, and +3 from his Persuading bonus.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Players can use attribute checks and skills to attempt all manner of actions,
  from spreading rumors in a tavern to sneaking through a dungeon to foraging
  for food in the woods.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SETTING DIFFICULTY</b></h3>
<p>
  As an MC, when you consider how difficult an attribute check should be, use
  these guiding principles and adopt them to the specific circumstance in
  question.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TIERED SUCCESS</b></h3>
<p>
  It is narratively rewarding to set up an attribute check with different tiers
  of success. Using the above example, if Marcus is attempting to persuade a
  local official to lend aid to the party, then perhaps there are four possible
  outcomes, depending on how high Marcus rolls:
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The official might ignore Marcus and refuse even basic help (outright
    failure).
  </li>
  <li>
    Perhaps, the official will listen to the heroes and then redirect them: “Not
    my problem; go talk to the sheriff.” This would be considered a failure in
    that the official did not lend aid, but not a complete failure; the official
    offered a lead for the party to pursue.
  </li>
  <li>With a more positive outcome, the official might lend financial aid.</li>
  <li>
    The official might even give the heroes a formal writ that lets them act
    with the official’s legal blessing, giving them more access throughout the
    city.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FAILING FORWARD</b></h3>
<p>
  When designing an attribute check, it is important to keep in mind that even
  failure should lead to progression in the story. For example, if characters
  are trying to sneak into an enemy stronghold, then failure might lead to
  combat; this still moves the story forward in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
  Conversely, if characters must find a secret room in an old manor, and they
  all fail on their AWR checks to do so, it could grind the story to a halt. In
  order to prevent this, make sure that every outright failure leads to another
  potential course of action.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Failing their AWR checks might mean that the characters DO still find the
  secret room, but it takes them so long that the manor’s cultist inhabitants
  return home and confront them… or perhaps a rival explorer finds a different
  way into the secret room first and steals the artifact the heroes were looking
  for.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  There will, of course, be the rare instance in which failure is just failure –
  provided that it does not lead to an outright dead end in the story’s
  progression. In the example of the manor’s hidden room, perhaps the heroes are
  investigating a larger mystery throughout the town. Just because they cannot
  find a hidden room in the manor does not mean that they cannot keep pursuing
  other leads.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DIFFICULTY RATING</b></h3>
<p>
  Here are some guidelines that you can use when determining the difficulty
  rating of an attribute check. You can use these guidelines to set different
  tiers of success; for example, outright failure might be a roll of 5 or less;
  failure with some consolation might be a roll of 6-9; success, a roll of
  10-15; and fantastic success with a best-case-scenario outcome if you roll 16
  or higher. These numbers should change dramatically based on the difficulty of
  the task undertaken.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Remember that attribute checks should only be made if there is a chance of
  failure. Finding food in an in-season orchard, for example, is a given and
  should not require an attribute check.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Note that adventurers can gain up to a +12 in an attribute (though they cannot
  get a +12 before level 21 due to the restrictions in how quickly you can gain
  Attribute Points), and can get up to a +20 in a skill if they focus on really
  becoming an expert in it.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  This means that by level 21, a character might have a +32 in a Specialized
  Skill, meaning that a high-level expert could automatically succeed a very
  hard check, but would need to roll a 15 or higher on a near-impossible check.
</p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>EXAMPLE SKILL CHALLENGES</b></h3>
<p>
  Here are a couple situations where you might ask your party to make some
  attribute checks. The difficulties in these examples assume a party of four
  adventurers that are all level 3 or lower.
</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b><br />RUMORS OF BANDITS</b>
</h4>
<p>
  The heroes have heard that there is a roving pack of bandits in the area, so
  they take it upon themselves to investigate. In order to quickly find the
  bandit group, the adventurers need to ask traveling merchants and local
  farmers and hunters if they have gotten word of the bandits or seen anything
  suspicious of late.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The adventurers can make CHA or INT checks to gain more information on them.
  If the heroes have the relevant skills, they might want to add their
  Eavesdropping, Gossipping, Intimidating, Persuading, or Savoir Faire bonuses.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Each PC can make a check. They gain Successes based on the following table.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If the heroes collectively get fewer than 4 Successes, then when they find the
  group of bandits, the bandits have had time to recruit more members. Add 2
  additional bandits to the encounter.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Conversely, if the adventurers collectively get more than 6 successes, then
  when they find the bandit group, run the battle with one fewer bandit as the
