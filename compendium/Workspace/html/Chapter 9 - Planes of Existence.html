<h2><b>PLANES OF EXISTENCE</b></h2>
<p>
  Gathandia and Ancerra are not the only places that daring heroes might
  explore. Adventurers, especially those of higher character level, might
  journey into the planes of existence beyond the mortal coil. Ancerra and other
  worlds on the same plane of existence are believed to be on the “Prime
  Material” plane, according to planar scholars.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>AVADRIA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Once a plane of boundless light and radiant creations, the Eon War between the
  Paragon and Corrupted Avadri destroyed Avadria’s former splendor. It is now a
  silent, desolate plane filled with tendrils of the Pale and debris of millions
  of dead worlds. Avadria consists of entire galaxies that have gone dark. Cold,
  lightless stars still form the centers of silent solar systems and lifeless
  mechanical planets orbit around them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  There is no gravity here, and the space is breathable even when between
  planets. There is no light whatsoever, and the shadows seem to actively eat
  away at any light source. Terrors larger than planets stalk the umbral plains,
  surviving off of the refuse of an obliterated civilization. Maddened fae
  linger here, as well as denizens of the Pale.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Many scholars believe that the enormous machines that orbit dormant in these
  galaxies will one day awaken again and either set their galaxies back in order
  or break out of Avadria, bringing the plane’s desolation to the whole
  multiverse.
</p>
<h3><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Alshahath. </b>The ruined shell of Alshahath, homeworld of the Avadri,
  still drifts through empty space as its star detonated eons ago. Its surface a
  mess of molten metal and frigid wastelands, the technology possibly contained
  within the deepest recesses of the planet holds the power to ascend any mortal
  to godhood or beyond.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Star-Forges. </b>The various star-forges and world-forges that survived
  the Eon War still retain the ability to create and disassemble entire solar
  systems. Anyone capable of harnessing these massive machines in their full
  power can create their own demi-planar planet.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Thyre. </b>Thyre, last fortress of the scattered Avadri resistance, lies at
  the intersection between Avadria and the long-forgotten Fundamental Plane. The
  entire planet has been converted to a colossal warcamp, radiant structures
  forming a majority of its observable landscape. The air and sky are near
  absolutely pure. The Avadri guardians who are still alive dwell within this
  bastion.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>THE CELESTIAL SEA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The Celestial Sea is a vast planar ocean that connects the Prime Existence,
  Avadria, Everwilds, Inferno, and Iztari. It allows safe travel between planes
  without having to travel through the dangerous Pale, which envelops the
  Celestial Sea on all sides beyond the planes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Celestial Sea always teems with trillions of stars, but these are not
  physical stars that produce heat and energy. Instead, stars on the Celestial
  Sea are bits of Essence that form together to create souls.
</p>
<h3><b>SOULS AND ESSENCE</b></h3>
<p>
  A soul is the Essence cultivated within a single living creature. One soul
  cannot live multiple times, because when a creature dies and their Essence
  returns to the Celestial Sea, their Essence doesn’t remain stuck together.
  This makes resurrection impossible after a number of years, depending on how
  long it takes for a Soul’s Essence to dissolve back into the Celestial Sea.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This is also why some Resurrection results in a person having their
  personality changed, some of their memory being lost, or some other
  combination of unique mental/personality challenges: a person’s Soul might
  have begun to dissolve, and when they are forcibly resurrected back into a
  body then the process might bring back their incomplete Essence or might bring
  other ambient Essence (perhaps Essence that was once part of a different soul
  and still has different memories and personality associated with it) back into
  the same body.
</p>
<h2><b>THE EVERWILDS</b></h2>
<p>
  The Everwilds are an endless tangle of dramatic natural landscapes. Sprawling
  deserts, enormous forests full of towering trees, blizzard-scoured tundras,
  and impossibly deep oceans all jumble together in an illogical swirl. While
  towns and settlements exist in the Everwilds, it is truly the domain of
  nature. Each natural environment is at its most dramatic in the Everwilds.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Travelers who journey into the Everwilds will quickly realize that space and
  time are relative in this plane. Adventurers may journey across a sweeping
  grassland towards a towering mountain; while the mountain looks to be a day’s
  journey away, it may take them an hour or a week to reach the mountain. They
  will also find, upon returning to the Prime Material, that a week in the
  Everwilds might have only been half that time in the Prime Material. Other
  travelers experience the opposite, realizing that two weeks have passed in
  Ancerra for every week they spent in the Everwilds.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Of all the planes outside of the Prime Material, the Everwilds has the most
  portals. It is easier to travel back and forth between the Prime Material and
  the Everwilds than any other plane, either through the use of spells or
  through finding numerous magical portals throughout the world. Because of
  this, there is quite a strong presence of fae creatures and fae humanoids in
  Ancerra, and humanoid settlements in the Everwilds are not very uncommon.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Much of the Everwilds is a collage of dramatic natural landscapes that do not
  follow the natural laws of weather and terrain. Jungles may border on tundras,
  which might in turn give way to tropical archipelagos. However, the six
  Archfae Conclaves exert significant influence on the land immediately around
  them. The natural environment around each conclave reflects the general
  disposition of the conclave’s members.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The six Archfae Conclaves, along with their basic attitudes and how this
  shapes the world around them, are described below.
</p>
<h3><b>ASHYIDIR</b></h3>
<p>
  The Ashyidir Conclave embodies the four prime elements - fire, water, earth,
  and air - along with their derivatives. Fire and water together make steam,
  while fire and earth make magma, for example. The Ashyidir have a variety of
  dispositions but are generally driven by emotion rather than deliberative
  thought. The natural environment around the Ashyidir Conclave morphs to
  emphasize the four prime elements. Islands might float in the sky, waterfalls
  might flow upwards, and forest fires might be more common.
</p>
<h3><b>LETSPINA</b></h3>
<p>
  The six Archfae of the Letspina Conclave each represent one of the six senses
  typical to mammals: touch, taste, sight, hearing, smell, and instinct. They
  are generally curious about the world, trying to gain more input about their
  surroundings and unlikely to make hasty decisions. The natural world near the
  Letspina Conclave is especially vibrant.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Some might relish the sensory overload: the wind feels a little sharper, the
  rustling grass sounds a little more crisp. Others might find this a bit
  overwhelming.
</p>
<h3><b>PASHAK</b></h3>
<p>
  The Pashak Conclave consists of Archfae that represent the spiritual
  embodiment of various plants. They are generally seen as the slowest and most
  deliberative out of the conclaves, and consequently are typically considered
  the wisest. The vegetation around the Pashak Conclave is the healthiest in the
  entire multiverse.
</p>
<h3><b>SHIBMAR</b></h3>
<p>
  Archfae of the Shibmar Conclave are the embodiments of many different animals.
  The personalities of each Shibmar Archfae reflect more of the animal’s
  spiritual characteristics than the physical, as virtually every animal seeks
  food, shelter, and companionship in approximately that order. Animals in close
  proximity to the Shibmar Conclave are highly intelligent compared to their
  mundane kin; some can even speak fluently.
</p>
<h3><b>STRAVON</b></h3>
<p>
  The Stravon Conclave is the most mischievous of the six. The Archfae in this
  conclave each embody a dichotomy of emotions, such as love and hate. Oberon
  and Titania, the king and queen of this conclave, are at times volatile and at
  times deliberative. Many Stravon Archfae enjoy playing practical jokes on
  other Archfae and on mortals. The natural world near the Stravon Conclave is
  more prone to odd juxtapositions of environments, such as jungle trees growing
  out of a glacier.
</p>
<h3><b>VERTUMNA</b></h3>
<p>
  The Vertumna Conclave is the smallest conclave, with only four Archfae. They
  each represent a season and work with one another in perfect synchrony. Unlike
  the other conclaves, which often bicker internally, the Vertumna understand
  that each of them play a crucial role in the progression of time. Without
  spring rains, crops would fail, and without winter’s snows, rivers that rely
  on runoff might dry up. The natural world near the Vertumna Conclave is the
  most stable and recognizable to a traveler from the Prime Material. Seasons
  progress logically in Vertumna territory, and plants grow in their appropriate
  environs.
</p>
<h2><b>INFERNO</b></h2>
<p>
  Though Inferno itself functions outside the normal senses and structures of
  mortal existence, the Fiends are well known as the very embodiment of
  malicious and evil intent. The landscape of Inferno is similarly malicious,
  though it is unknown whether the terrifying and hostile plane is a result of
  Fiends that inhabit it or if the Fiends are a result of their environment.
  Philosophy aside, it is certain that Inferno is one of the most dangerous and
  inhospitable places any mortal could find themselves.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Time and space move differently in Inferno than they do in the Prime Material,
  making distance and proximity impossible to measure, and one’s perception of
  being is heavily influenced by the willpower of an individual. A mortal might
  find themselves walking the same lonely stretch of 100 yards for years or
  moving across entire continents in a single step. Countless spirits who have
  dared enter Inferno have simply vanished, fragmented through mind-breaking
  confusion and lost to fog of incomprehension, without ever laying eyes on the
  malefic Fiends that stalk its recesses. These are the luckiest travelers to
  Inferno.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Inferno’s hellscape is divided into four domains, each with distinct topology
  and nightmarish creatures.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Cholereth, Melaneth, Phlegmereth, and Sanguineth are the four broadest
  categories of fiend into which most fiends can be sorted, and these are also
  the names that scholars use to refer to the four regions of Inferno. Each
  domain also has one defining characteristic.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Exiles, having been expelled from Iztari, make their home in Inferno as
  well. Many of them, especially Mikhael, have risen to prominence and are
  capable of contesting the archfiends for dominance over Inferno’s regions.
</p>
<h3><b>CHOLERETH</b></h3>
<p>
  Dominated by the burning desert of Kalk’gahrak, the domain of Cholereth
  stretches endlessly as a brutal waste. Ash and coal intermingles with
  glass-sharp sand beneath a blood-red sky. Across these dunes, warbands of
  Cholereth fiends lead an endless slaughter as they fight for dominance with
  greater archfiends in an effort to dominate the region. These conflicts may
  last thousands of years before one fiend is finally victorious and moves on to
  battle the next fiend.
</p>
<h3><b>MELANETH</b></h3>
<p>
  Durlossoth, the Black City, is an endless collection of tightly packed stone
  buildings in various stages of decay and ruin. Occupying the whole of
  Melaneth, the Black City is full of nonsensical alleyways that twist between
  structures of no unifying architecture.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Overhead, a cloudy sky is stuck in perpetual twilight. The streets seem to
  shift around its lost wanderers, keeping souls from ever finding their way
  out. Pale-skinned Melaneth fiends stalk the shadows as gaunt, hunched figures
  of bone and sinew with hollow eye sockets and twisting voids of blackness at
  their cores. They are just as likely to welcome you with disingenuous
  fang-toothed smiles as they are to jump upon you with hooked claws and crude
  weapons. The buildings themselves come in every shape and size but always
  contain neglected furnishings of gnarled black wood.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Obsidian Palace. </b>At the heart of Durlossoth stands a grand palace
  carved from one solid piece of obsidian. Fortifications and spires loom over
  the ruined buildings, sprouting countless ballista and defensive emplacements.
  These sit unmanned and forgotten. The great obsidian gates are left ajar so
  that any who come upon the palace may enter freely. Inside, grand halls
  stretch for miles with all the trappings one might expect to find from noble
  holdings, each room seeming like the occupants left only moments before. Great
  paintings depict unidentifiable conflicts, the spilling of blood, countless
  representations of suffering, and twisted portraits with screaming faces. At
  the center of it all is the throne room of Sahrnulothon, Prince of Ruin.
</p>
<h3><b>PHLEGMERETH</b></h3>
<p>
  The embodiments of plague and infection, the fiends of Phlegmereth lurk in the
  silent bog of Xarnoas. The landscape of Xarnoas consists of flat, sparse
  boglands covered in a sea of needle-sharp blades of grass, occasionally
  interrupted by stagnant pools of icy-cold water. Xarnoas is almost completely
  silent aside from the buzzing that emanates from thick clouds of stinging
  insects that swarm across the waterways. Very few creatures live in this
  miserable place, but that does not make it any less dangerous. Large ambush
  predators vaguely reminiscent of crocodiles lie in wait in the shallows.
  Bulbous mounds of fungus sprout whipping protrusions that infect any they
  sting with rotting, transformative growths. Diseases are rampant here, and
  every paper-thin cut leaves a body in life-threatening danger from infection.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Cathedral of Phlegm. </b>While villages of stilted hovels can be found
  throughout Xarnoas, only one lasting structure stands at its heart. The
  Cathedral of Phlegm is a massive ruin of ancient stones from an unknown era
  now sagging into the soft earth. Thick, stinking moss threatens to swallow the
  cathedral whole. The Six Bishops, the rulers of Phlegmereth, meditate on the
  power of plague amongst a flock of infected fiends and other unfortunate
  beings forever cursed with maladies of every horrific imagining. These
  powerful archfiends are not immune to the spread of illness, instead seeing
  every pustule and rash as a sign of divine favor worthy of excessive
  meditation and reflection.
</p>
<h3><b>SANGUINETH</b></h3>
<p>
  The jungles of Ogshora, also known as “the Red Glade,” dominates the domain of
  the Sanguineth. Thick, hot air chokes fetid waterways of coppery red liquid
  similar in taste and smell to mortal blood. These streams flow around large
  copses of fleshy, tumorous growths that resemble mangrove trees. Blood-sucking
  leeches, giant bloated ticks, toxic frogs, and swarms of carnivorous birds are
  some of the creatures one might encounter in these horrid jungles. The plant
  life is just as deadly.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Den of Delights. </b>Deep within the Red Glade, the most unlucky
  travelers will find the home of Ogshora’s archfiend prince, Thaniasmos. The
  Den of Delights is an ancient ruin draped in flayed skins still dripping with
  blood. Thaniasmos feeds off of the emotions of mortals like a connoisseur
  sampling the finest of wines. Thaniasmos’s most prized souls are kept in
  torment for ages as their spirits are slowly consumed in the most prolonged
  and painful of ways.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>IZTARI</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The dramatic and beautiful plane of Iztari is home of the celestials. The
  plane is structured as an enormous, gently sloping mountain that never becomes
  too difficult to breathe despite its great heights. The snow at the peak of
  the mountain is pleasantly cold but never causes serious frostbite. Similarly,
  the whitewater rapids that cascade down the mountain never drown anyone, as
  the water is magically breathable. Various celestial creatures dwell on the
  different elevations of the mountain. Ponycorns graze in the lush foothills,
  Chamroshes Sphinxes soar above the treetops, Daeva and Narai splash in the
  waterfalls, and the Celestial Council oversees it all.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  At the top of the mountain, the Celestial Council’s great hall is carved from
  brilliant marble. Within this hall, the Council debates over planar
  legislation and argues whether they should allow the Exiles to return from
  Inferno and rejoin the ranks of the Celestials.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>THE EXILES</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Thousands of years ago, when factions of Celestials found themselves unable to
  reach a consensus regarding their role as planar protectors, heated debate
  boiled into war. Tovare and her defenders eventually won the war and they cast
  out the dissidents, Mikhael and his followers, consigning them to eternity in
  Inferno. Rather than simply accepting their punishment, Mikhael and his
  followers set about warring with the archfiends and trying to become the new
  lords of Inferno.
</p>
<h2><b>THE PALE</b></h2>
<p>
  The Pale is the space in between. It is the edge of creation. Whatever
  darkness is to light, the Pale is to reality. It is a blank canvas to the most
  powerful gods, and incomprehensible to most mortals. Eldritch beings lurk
  within the Pale as crawling things hide in the shadows.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  What lives in the pale could drive most intelligent beings insane by simply
  gazing upon it. What comes out of the pale are nightmarish, otherworldly
  outsiders that are hard to even keep record of. Even the words on the page
  crawl. Beings without powerful magic to shield their mind cannot enter the
  Pale.
</p>
