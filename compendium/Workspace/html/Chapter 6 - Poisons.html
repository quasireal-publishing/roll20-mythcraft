<p><em>Lethality: High</em></p>
<p><em>Transmissibility: None</em></p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Application: </b>A creature gains Basilisk-Eye poisoning when being
  successfully struck with a weapon coated in Basilisk-Eye goo, a very rare and
  difficult to create poison distilled from a fresh Basilisk eye.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Symptoms: </b>An infected creature gains the following symptoms at the
  start of each of the following days (after Taking a Rest, if they were able to
  Rest). The effects are cumulative.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Day 1:</b> Gain Shaken as slight tremors rack your hands and feet.</li>
  <li><b>Day 2: </b>Gain Slowed as your joints lock up.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Day 3+: </b>Make a DC 18 END check. On a failure, you become Petrified as
    your skin turns to rough stone. If successful, you do not gain any
    additional symptoms. Repeat this check every day.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing Basilisk-Eye poisoning requires a successful DC 15
  INT/Medicine check that includes a salve made from crushed diamond. This check
  consumes the salve, which costs at least 200 sc. Additionally, an infected
  individual is cured if they successfully make three END checks to avoid
  Petrification. A creature that is Petrified can be cured with Greater
  Restoration and similar magic.

    also cannot benefit from the Focused or Rallied conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hour 10-12: </b>The mushrooms begin to release Deepshroom Spores. All
    creatures within 15 ft must make a DC 17 END check, becoming infected with
    Deepshroom Poisoning if they fail. Gain the Blinded and Silenced condition
    as the mushrooms continue to sprout.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hour 13-17: </b>Make a DC 17 END check. On a success, gain Fatigue and
    make this roll again the following hour. If you fail, you immediately
    transform into a <b>Deepshroom Shambler </b>and gain the appropriate stat

    from foe and must seek out living humanoids to infect with Deepshroom
    Poisoning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hour 18: </b>If you make enough successful END checks to reach hour 18
    without transforming, you do not transform into a Deepshroom Shambler and
    instead immediately die.

    <b>Deepshroom Hive </b>after 7 days.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Treatment: </b>Curing the Deepshroom Toxin requires one or more DC 18
  INT/Medicine checks that require herbs and bandages. If the check is made with
  anti-fungal cream or while in direct sunlight, the DC is lowered to 13. Each
  check consumes one use of herbs, bandages, and cream. You cannot receive more
  than 1 check per hour. If turned into a Deepshroom Shambler, Greater
  Restoration and similar magic can restore you to merely being infected as
  though in Hour 4 of having consumed Deepshroom Toxin.
