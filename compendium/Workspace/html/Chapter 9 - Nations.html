  <b>AHTEN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  An ancient nation that developed along the River Ahten, this region would be
  terribly inhospitable if not for its mighty water source. The River Ahten
  flows reliably from a ground spring in the nation’s northwest and follows a
  predictable seasonal calendar down to the week. It floods every spring, and
  the water level lowers by a couple feet every fall. The river’s predictability
  has allowed the nation of Ahten to thrive.
</p>
<br />

  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  The land, otherwise arid and rocky desert, is a flourishing oasis along the
  river. Farmers use the predictable seasonal flows to harvest abundant crops,
  which they use to enhance Ahten’s international economy. This is all overseen
  by a revered godking.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Ahten has several prominent universities, the largest of
  which is in Khamen, the capital. Ahten’s scholars and scientists are quite
  prestigious, and their universities draw the interest of scholars from across
  the continent. The headmasters of each university in Ahten are sphinxes who
  relish the constant access to books and intellectual stimulation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic, Political, and Religious. </b>A theomonarchical dynasty rules
  Ahten. Each monarch is proclaimed to be a demigod, an emissary between gods
  and humanoids. When a demigod monarch dies, the nation goes into mourning for
  thirty days. Monarchs have enormous, elaborate mausoleums and are believed to
  ascend to full godhood upon their deaths, where they watch over Ahten’s
  prosperity. Ahten’s current godking, Pharenkan, places a strong focus on the
  nation’s military given the threat that Roshallan poses.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>In addition to Ahten’s renowned universities,
  Ahten produces tremendous amounts of crops given its arid climate. It also
  mines salt and gold from the foothills of the volcanic mountains to its
  northeast. Furthermore, Ahten has negotiated mining agreements with its
  neighbor, Gavare, which allows Ahteni miners to operate in Gavare’s territory
  of the Smoldering Canyon. This supplements Ahten’s economy with magical
  crafted goods and with ink pigments that contain magical properties.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Ahten’s soldiers are sturdy and resilient to the extreme heat
  of the arid summer. Each soldier that graduates from training is tattooed with
  magical ink pigments from the Smoldering Canyon, enabling them to go for more
  days at a time without food and water than they otherwise could. Competent on
  chariots and horseback, and skilled in the ways of desert fighting, they have
  been able to keep Roshallan at bay.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Ahten’s large agrarian community quickly developed advanced
  agricultural practices and infrastructure.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The River Ahten floods predictably every year, allowing farmers to utilize
  floodwaters to their greatest irrigational effect. Because of the river’s
  predictability, many in Ahten view it as sacred and understand that their
  society might crumble if the river ever missed a year of its predictable
  patterns. Ahteni common folk tend to be hospitable towards one another but
  suspicious of strangers. Most Ahteni are very reverent of their godkings.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>When one of the Ahteni monarchs dies, they are buried with
  many riches. This draws irreverent tomb raiders in search of easy loot. The
  catch, of course, is that many of these tombs are riddled with booby traps and
  curses designed to repel looters. Furthermore, as repayment for being made
  headmasters of the universities, Ahteni sphinxes guard the tombs with
  alacrity.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THREE MAJOR CITIES</b></h3>
<p>
  Ahten has three major cities, in addition to numerous towns and farming
  communities along the river. These major cities each house one of Ahten’s most
  famous universities.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Isirem. </b>Isirem is Ahten’s most populous city, located at the mouth of
  the River Ahten. Its access to the ocean makes it a valuable trading hub with
  other nations that engage in maritime trade.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Khalen. </b>Ahten’s capital is located approximately halfway between the
  river’s spring and its mouth. Khalen boasts enormous monuments to the glory of
  Ahten and its gods, and the capital is also only a day’s camel ride from the
  Valley of the Gods. Khalen’s monuments were constructed primarily by golems.

  <b>Set’then. </b>The smallest of Ahten’s three major cities, Set’then is a
  fortified city that guards the river’s ground springs. If Roshallan were to
  conquer this city, then they could potentially dam the river, devastating
  Ahten.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Valley of Gods. </b>The Valley of Gods is where many enormous monuments
  have been built, along with elaborate mausoleums that have been dug into the
  side of the rocky hills in the area. Sphinxes and tomb raiders are constantly
  at war over this territory and the riches hidden deep within.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Smoldering Canyon. </b>The Smoldering Canyon, though primarily within
  Gavare’s borders, is important to Ahteni culture. The canyon is ripe with
  valuable minerals, such as mysterious avadrium, primor, and mithril. The
  canyon’s vegetation also produces pigments that can be used to create magical
  tattoos. Finally, the Smoldering Canyon produces magical flames and other
  energies that Ahteni scholars have learned how to contain in stable form.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    After a sphinx turned up missing, its colleagues send the heroes to

    possesses such strength? Can the heroes find and stop the thief?
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gavarese want to revoke the rights of the Ahteni miners to keep working
    in the Smoldering Canyon, but will abandon this threat if the Ahteni send
    heroes to defeat some mythical monster that has been causing strife for
    Gavarese mining towns.
  </li>
  <li>
    The River Ahten has flooded - three months early! What could have caused
    this, and what will it mean for the future of Ahten? Can the heroes
    investigate and restore the river to its natural flow?
  </li>
  <li>

</ul>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ANEDONIA</b></h2>
<p>
  Stretching across a pleasant environment of modest humidity, warm summers, and
  mild rainy winters, Anedonia is a federation of city-states that share the
  same cultural practices, holidays, and religious beliefs, though each
  city-state has different governing systems and economic strengths. The
  Anedonian islands are rocky but temperate, allowing pastoral culture to
  flourish alongside orchards of olives and citrus.
</p>
<img
  data-filename="Anedonia"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961617/YUbSXhQRcrKE_ipTPPTPAw/original.png?1771159305"
  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<br />
<p>
  The Anedonian city-states operate independently of one another in most
  instances and have waged war on one another at various points throughout
  history. However, the whole of Anedonia has rallied together whenever they
  feel that their way of life faces existential threat, and when united in such
  fashion they are a tremendous force to be reckoned with. Even the mighty
  Empire of Roshallan has been unable to subjugate Anedonia due to the
  Anedonians’ fierce loyalty to their nation above the differences of their
  individual states.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Anedonians primarily worship the Ashyidir and Stravon
  Conclaves of the Archfae and have spun elaborate mythologies around these
  deities. Although many of these stories never actually occurred, the way that
  the deities are depicted in these stories is reasonably accurate. Each
  Anedonian city-state has one patron deity but pays homage to all deities out
  of these Conclaves.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Anedonian society revolves around free-market maritime traders.
  Many of Anedonia’s city-states are island nations, so in addition to pastoral
  and orchard cultivation, the city-states also thrive on a fishing industry.
  Anedonians are very hospitable to those from any other Anedonian city-state
  unless they are actively at war with that state. They are generally courteous
  but suspicious of foreigners.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>It has not acquired great power yet, but a criminal empire
  has taken root in Anedonia and is working to extend its influence to every
  city-state. The criminal empire aims to unite the states into a formal nation
  with the crime lords as the new oligarchs.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CITY-STATES OF NOTE</b></h3>
<p>
  Anedonia’s three most prominent city-states are described in a little more
  detail below, but this is only three out of a couple dozen city-states that
  are part of the Anedonian federation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Sethan. </b>The most economically influential of Anedonia’s city-states,
  Sethan occupies a large island near Anedonia’s mainland coast. The Sethan
  Academy is the most prestigious in the world, drawing scholars from the whole
  world to teach their disciplines. Sethan is ruled using an elected senate. In
  times of crisis, the other city-states of Anedonia will rally behind Sethan as
  the effective capital of all the city-states.

<br />
<p>
  <b>Taspar. </b>Taspar is the largest city-state on Anedonia’s mainland, and
  the closest to the Roshallani border. It is an autocratic city-state that
  trains its citizens to be soldiers from the time they are only four years old.
  This produces some of the toughest, most calloused soldiers in all Gathandia
  and has prevented Roshallan from gaining a foothold in Anedonia. While Taspar
  and Sethan have strenuous philosophical disagreements, they respect one
  another’s accomplishments and view each other as steadfast allies. Taspar’s
  King Lendonar has proven a mighty military commander and Roshallan has yet to
  make any headway on conquering Anedonia due to Lendonar’s efforts.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Terec. </b>Terec has a much smaller population than Sethan and Taspar, and
  is far from the third most populous city-state. It is, however, the third most
  notable in terms of its contributions to Anedonian society. Situated on a
  large island deeper into the Inner Sea, Terec possesses deep mines rich in
  many minerals, including the mystical minerals known as Avadrium and Mithril.
  Terec’s deep mines have entire towns in their crossroads, but the still
  unexplored caverns beneath this island are riddled with all manner of
  dangerous beasts.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Terec’s merchant leadership have asked the heroes to clear out some terrible
    beasts that lurk in the lower stretches of caverns that Terec wishes to
    begin mining.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sethan has attracted the interest of a scholar from Getar who wishes for the
    heroes to protect them in the journey across the Inner Sea.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taspar has come under threat from Roshallan, and they are looking for any
    competent soldiers to take up arms and help reclaim a tactically
    advantageous set of foothills.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>BETAAL</b></h2>
<p>
  A small nation that makes its home on the tops of several of the Cloudpiercer
  Mountains, Betaal’s size in no way reflects its significance. Its people are
  tough, innovative, and capable of surviving with quite little. The Betaalese
  are also held to be generous and hospitable with foreigners, although few ever
  reach Betaal’s highest cities in the peaks of its tallest mountains.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Betaal"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961600/sewr3uMq_B5dVfQG6S8eQQ/original.png?1771159301"
  style="width: 318px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Each of Betaal’s towns has a monastery where scholars,
  clergy, and mystics can study or meditate. These monasteries focus much more
  on the spiritual aspects of the humanoid experience than on traditional
  academic topics, although Betaal’s two largest cities do have large libraries
  as well.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Betaalese society rejects the idea of a
  ruling elite and believe that those capable of shepherding other people’s
  souls should do so on both a spiritual and political level. As such, Betaal’s
  religious leaders - the Prabi - are also its political leaders. If such a
  leader ever displays an exorbitant lifestyle, they are removed from their
  order, as asceticism is one of their central tenets.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Betaal has little in the way of natural
  resources, other than yaks and snow. Betaal exports both wool and water in
  abundance, and the dry nation of Kandiff regularly buys water from Betaal.
  Betaal also exports philosophy, fictional literature, and artistic works,
  though they must first import dyes and other mediums for these artworks from
  other nations. Betaal imports raw and finished materials, along with
  foodstuffs, from any nation that they can reach for trade. They generally
  trade with Kandiff, Noord, and Doshairiel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Taking life is heavily frowned upon in Betaal, which is
  generally a highly pacifistic nation. When Betaal is attacked, mystics and
  psions will use their telekinetic powers to cause avalanches or illusory
  spectacles that will dissuade aggressors from attempting to take Betaal.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The Prabi practice extreme asceticism. When they are not
  legislating or counseling their constituents, they often meditate. Many are
  known to be capable of astral projection and other great psionic powers, and
  they purport to have spoken directly with representatives of the Celestial
  Council. It is believed that when a Betaalese monk is chosen to lead a town,
  they are invited into a psionic mind palace that has been around for thousands
  of years and contains the wisdom of every Prabi that came before.

<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Like the monks that lead or train to lead the nation, many of
  the Betaalese common folk also practice asceticism, though not to the degree
  practiced by the monks. Most commoners do not see the need for any wealth
  beyond enough food and shelter for their families, and perhaps some
  entertaining books or games to pass the cold, dark nights. Betaalese are
  hospitable to foreign travelers and will usually offer guidance through the
  steep and treacherous mountains.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Shinus are independently operating cells of skilled
  assassins that wear folded cloth armor, allowing them to approach their
  victims silently. Most underworld activity in Betaal is performed by Shinus. A
  small group of highly skilled Shinus, operating outside the purview of the
  theocratic rulers of Betaal, will infiltrate and destabilize nations that they
  think might threaten Betaal. Some of these Shinus also become mercenaries,
  selling their specialized services to any with enough coin. By both taking
  life and hoarding wealth, Betaalese Shinus are antithetical to the teachings
  of the official leaders.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TAPSANKAD</b></h3>
<p>
  The oldest Betaalese city, Tapsankad is nestled just beneath the highest peak
  in Betaal. The peak of the mountain is left bare as it is a holy site where
  monks go to engage in astral projection and, when the time comes, to transcend
  beyond this world. Tapsankad is a city rich with ancient history, having been
  founded before the World-Quake.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Within the city, Tapsankad contains many residences, some modest markets, and
  curated parks lush with cold-weather plants. The citizens of Tapsankad hold
  festivals on each solstice and each equinox, which are the only days each year
  where hedonism is not viewed in contempt.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The heroes must climb the Cloudpiercer Mountains to reach Tapsankad. There,
    they must entreat the monks to send more water and spare Kandiff from a
    terrible drought.
  </li>
  <li>
    One of Betaal’s towns has been attacked by an icy monster. The Prabi ask the
    heroes to go defeat the monster and liberate its citizens.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tension is mounting between the Prabi and the Shinus as the Noords threaten
    to conquer Betaal. The heroes must decide who they agree with and seek to
    broker a peace or, short of that, throw their support behind one faction or
    the other.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>BISHAL</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The wide open plains and arid steppes of Bishal are home to several large
  tribes, all of whom share a general culture but who are often at war with one
  another.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Bishal"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961612/749SXz68uFkSAEo7K8NZAQ/original.png?1771159304"
  style="width: 451px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Each Bishalian tribe follows a nomadic lifestyle, leading their massive horse
  herds to fresh pastures or following the herds of bison that they use for
  food, tools, and clothing.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Each tribal lord is responsible for their
  own tribe’s actions but has little interest in the other tribes beyond
  occasional trades or skirmishes. On the rare occasions that multiple tribal
  lords feel that their entire nation is threatened, then the lords will come
  together where the two major rivers in Bishal join together into one. There,
  the lords will negotiate working together and for how long they are bound to
  do so. The largest and most belligerent Bishalian tribal lord is named Tilion,
  and he has made quite a name for himself and his tribe as a military power to
  be reckoned with.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Bishalians typically trade internally instead of
  internationally. They use clay from the riverbeds to make pottery, and use
  every part of bison and other game animals to make food and various tools or
  clothes. Usually, if they consider trading with a foreign town or merchant
  caravan, they will instead just raid it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Bishalians make excellent cavaliers, and many Bishalian
  warriors are more at home on horseback than they are on foot. Capable of
  firing shortbows while riding, a Bishalian tribe’s warriors can conduct quick
  and brutal raids on the towns of other nations that border their territory.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious and Social. </b>The people of Bishal tend to be very religious
  and believe horses to be sacred animals. They worship A’rl’ng, the great steed
  of the Shibmar Conclave of the Archfae, as a guiding patron. Most Bishalians
  believe in a cycle of reincarnation where when a humanoid dies, they are
  reborn as a horse, and when a horse dies, they are reborn as a humanoid.
  People generally hold that Centaurs are the reincarnations of especially brave
  or honorable humanoids or steeds.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE RIVERFLOW</b></h3>

  <b>BRIDGEMOOR</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Bridgemoor is an economically powerful independent city-state built entirely
  on a massive bridge that spans the Great Chasm. As the only other ways to
  cross the chasm involve going hundreds of miles north to circumvent it or
  climbing down, navigating across its monster-riddled trenches, and climbing
  back up, Bridgemoor has made a fortune off of merchants and travelers that use
  the city-state as passage over the Chasm.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Bridgemoor"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961615/wX5E31CKgb7wl5mjpERyBw/original.png?1771159305"
  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Bridgemoor is just large enough that a full day’s travel will not quite get
  one across the chasm, forcing travelers to spend extra coin in one of
  Bridgemoor’s many inns and taverns. Through this calculated design and by
  exacting a small toll on every traveler, Bridgemoor thrives.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Bridgemoor is governed by an oligarchy known as the Meritocrats. Selected once
  every ten years, prospective Meritocrats must first pass a test proving their
  scholastic and economic knowledge, and then each former Meritocrat picks their
  successor. This has generally led to rampant nepotism with very rare
  exceptions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Bridgemoor has a large university and scholastic achievements
  are widely celebrated throughout the city-state. Those with more formal
  education are more likely to be rewarded by Meritocrats or become one
  themselves, so anyone who can afford to send their children to the university
  will do so.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Bridgemoor is a thriving mercantile state. Due to
  a high volume of travelers and merchants flowing into and through the
  city-state, Bridgemoor has one of the strongest economies in its region. It
  trades especially frequently with Nalathesh and Kendaria as it connects the
  two nations, but merchants from other nations will stop in Bridgemoor on their
  way to or from Kendaria and Nalathesh as well.

  <b>Militant. </b>Bridge Knight Commander Ser Kellion Blacksky maintains strict
  discipline in the streets of Bridgemoor. Under his guidance, the Bridge
  Knights have become more disciplined and competent than they have ever been
  historically. Few in number, the Bridge Knights could not wage war on a
  neighboring country, but they could defend Bridgemoor indefinitely or until
  food and water run out.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Political. </b>The Meritocrats oversee legislation and appoint the Bridge
  Knight Commander and the Master Magister. These two figures, in turn, will
  appoint their subordinate administrators (Bridge Knight Captains and
  Magisters, respectively) to maintain executive and judicial law within the
  city.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Bridgemoor does not have an official religion, and each
  citizen is encouraged to pursue their own beliefs. Several temples dedicated
  to specific pantheons or tenets can be found throughout Bridgemoor, along with
  unaffiliated houses of worship that offer a quiet, contemplative space for any
  belief system.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Bridgemoor has a very diverse culture. Folk from Nalathesh and
  Kendaria make up most of Bridgemoor’s citizens, but some traders from lands
  beyond decided to settle in Bridgemoor as well, leading to a confluence of
  many beliefs. It’s not uncommon for there to be at least two festivals in a
  given month due to the wide spectrum of cultures and religions and their
  respective celebratory events.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Bridgemoor has no shortage of white-collar criminals that
  use any loophole in the city-state’s tax system and mercantile economy to line
  their own pockets with a little more silver and gold. Overt crime is uncommon
  thanks to Ser Kellion’s iron discipline, but cult activity lurks in the sewers
  and storage cellars beneath the streets. Called the Underbridge Cult, these
  miscreants are a countercultural movement looking to prove how meaningless and
  absurd “Meritocracy” truly is. Among other things, they try to summon fiends
  from Inferno to wreak havoc in the city.

  Bridgemoor spans one of its narrowest points, connecting Nalathesh to

  <b>BUYLEIST</b>
</h2>
<p>
  For many generations, Buyleist was significantly weaker than its neighbor
  nation, Unjaarn. Buyleist’s rulers lived under the constant shadow of fear
  that Unjaar would decide to invade them or cut them off from international
  trade, and unfortunately this did come to pass a couple generations ago.
</p>

  style="width: 408px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  As it turns out, this was a mistake on Unjaar’s part. Buyleist made an
  alliance with Vel, and Vel’s nefarious mages sowed discord in Unjaar’s
  internal affairs. This eventually led to a complete schism within Unjaar,
  which resulted in the nation splitting in two. Now, the two split nations -
  Unjaar and Vadan - are both smaller and weaker than Buyleist, allowing the
  Buyleistians to flex their muscles in the region.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Buyleist is building its first major university and hopes to
  attract scholars from other nations to help get the educational program off
  the ground. Vel’s Mages of the Beach are more than willing to assist in this
  process.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Buyleist rejects the notion of aristocracy
  or a caste system wholesale. Instead, their governing body is a representative
  democracy elected by any citizen who makes a large enough annual salary to be
  offered a ballot. While these elections offer the illusion of choice, the
  Mages of the Beach from Vel are really in charge and make sure that each
  “election” actually promotes a Buyleistian who will do exactly what the Mages
  instruct.

  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Buyleist exports many dye pigments, spices, and
  foodstuffs unique to the swamp delta.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While Unjaar and Vadan also export many of the same materials, Buyleist’s
  economic advantage allows them to undersell their competition.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant.</b> The military in Buyleist is medium-sized and quite competent.
  It could almost certainly defeat Vadan or Unjaar independently, but if the two
  made an alliance against Buyleist, then Buyleist might be in trouble.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>While Buyleistians can practice any religion that they wish,
  doing so is generally discouraged. The governing body reminds Buyleist’s
  citizenry that they are in such times of prosperity because of the wisdom and
  generosity of the Mages of the Beach, and it is truly the Mages who should be
  venerated.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Citizens of Buyleist are encouraged to pursue the careers and
  hobbies that most interest them. This keeps Buyleistians generally content and
  preoccupied with their own ventures, though some political dissidents speak
  out against their nation’s alliance with Vel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>The most fervent political opponents to Vel have formed a
  covert rebellion. This has not yet developed into violence, although many who
  are aware of the resistance movement think that it’s only a matter of time.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SELMORT</b></h3>
<p>
  The capital of Buyleist is the fortified stilt city of Selmort. The city is
  built in tiers, with wide, flat barges holding apartments where the poor live.
  Elevated platform houses, suspended over the swamp on stilts and connected by
  rope bridges, are home to the middle class and to the marketplaces.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A large bastion built of stone and clay is home to Buyleist’s national
  governing body. In the fetid swamps behind this bastion, a small M’l’ykkri has
  buried itself in the water. Political dissidents that upset the Mages of the
  Beach often wind up as snacks for this horrible monster.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Swamplands of the Great Chasm. </b>A humid tropical swamp spreads across a
  vast river delta on the southern end of the Great Chasm. Many small islands
  blanket this region, separated by shallow waters that would be treacherous for
  large boats. A wide variety of natural flora and fauna mix with the strange
  minerals and ancient technologies buried deep in the Chasm; as a result,
  unnatural land formations and horrible monsters lurk outside of the stilted
  cities and villages that speckle the swamplands. “Travel by day, and you’ll be
  safe; travel by night, you’ll get a fright” is a common rhyme in these lands,
  and children dare one another to explore the swamps outside their settlements.

    The heroes get accused of political malfeasance and risk becoming a

    The heroes might get caught up in the three-way trade war between Buyleist,
    Vadan, and Unjaar. They will have to carefully evaluate who they support.

    The Mages of the Beach promise great rewards to the heroes if they will find
    and quash a burgeoning rebellion.

  <b>CHEE</b>

<p>
  The forest nation of Chee used to be much larger and more prosperous.
  Originally, Chee was part of Chehozran, but after a short civil war they split
  along the mountain range that separates the two regions. Chee never recovered
  economically from the civil war, struggling to make an international name for
  itself. Before it was able to achieve any notable successes, Roshallan annexed
  Chee.

  governmental practices.

<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>In the privacy of their own homes, most Chee folk keep alive
  the traditions of their ancestors. Like the Chehozran, the Chee believe that
  one day the kaijan of old will return: some will be benevolent, and many will
  be tyrannical. They pray that the kaijan who return to the nation of Chee will
  strive to protect, rather than to destroy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>While many Chee folk wish that they could run their own country
  instead of being controlled by Roshallan, they also recognize that Roshallan’s
  powerful military offers them great security. Most folk of Chee simply go
  about their lives, helping out their friends when they can and avoiding
  strangers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Some nationalistic Chee folk have taken it upon themselves

</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DEEPROCK</b></h3>
<p>
  Chee’s only major city, Deeprock, is micromanaged by Roshallan. It has a
  fortified palace where a Roshallani regional king oversees the nation of Chee.
  A strong military presence keeps the peace, and Deeprock’s enormous shipyards
  produce large, powerful naval vessels at a rapid rate, which Roshallan uses to
  conquer other nations that border the Inner Sea.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Roshallan hires the heroes to head into Chee and put down a developing

    the heroes must weigh their morals and their desire for wealthy
    compensation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Roshallan will have unparalleled naval superiority if they can finish

  <b>CHEHOZRAN</b>

<p>
  Once an enormous forest nation that spread from the Inner Sea to the oceans

  ago, pragmatic leaders split the northeastern half of the nation off into the
  new kingdom of Chee in an effort to consolidate resources in two locations.
  Chee has since been conquered by Roshallan.

<p>
  Chehozran remains independent of Roshallan, but Chehozran continually adds
  additional fortifications and trained soldiers to its border as it anticipates
  invasion from the aggressive nation at any point.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Chehozran has little to offer in the way of formal schooling.
  The elderly in towns throughout the nation will often teach the young, and
  those who desire often travel to Pash to receive additional formal education.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Chehozran does not have an aristocracy
  besides the royal family. Following the tradition of primogeniture, each
  eldest child becomes the next monarch. Besides the monarchy, other officials
  and representatives are democratically elected. This preserves the continuity
  of leadership at the highest levels of government while allowing the people’s
  voices to be heard through local elections.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Chehozran produces sizable quantities of lumber,
  game, vegetables, minerals, clay, pigments, and fine art made using such
  materials. They primarily trade within the borders of their own nation but
  have open trade agreements with Pash.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>The military in Chehozran is large, skilled, and disciplined.
  They do not have the strongest iron or the most modern weaponry, but they know
  their terrain exceptionally well. Thus far, they have held off all preliminary
  Roshallani scouting parties.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Looking to the ancient past, the Chehozranese worship the
  kaijans of old. They believe that one day, the kaijans will return and will
  scour the world again. While this will cause much devastation, Chehozranese
  prophets claim that some among the kaijan will be protectors that shelter the
  faithful from the wrath of the other kaijans.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>The folk of Chehozran trust their own and will provide for one
  another. Shelter and food are considered communal, and few are ever left
  wanting. This hospitable practice is generally afforded to Pashans as well.
  This courtesy does not, however, extend to other foreigners, who are treated
  with suspicion if not outright hostility.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Given that Chehozran is focused on the threat of Roshallan,
  there are a handful of opportunistic gangs. A crime syndicate also extends
  throughout Chehozran, exploiting the air of fear.

  house Pashan merchant vessels. In preparation for the worst case scenario,

  Constel’s chief export is timber from the Old Forest. Loggers have deforested
  Constel so rapidly that it is now more plains and pasture than forest, much
  the opposite of what it was less than a hundred years ago. Traditionalists
  warn that this will be Constel’s doom: the Old Forest is strange and
  unforgiving of such sins. Progressives, however, argue that this was a
  necessary step to get Constel on its feet. The destruction of the Old Forest
  is largely what gave Constel the financial means to establish its university,
  which attracts intellectuals from the world over.

  <b>Academic. </b>Lentira has a large university with scholars that specialize
  in legal theory and philosophy. The University of Constel attracts many
  students from many nations, leading to a vast dissemination of ideas.
  Headmaster Edwardton keeps in very close contact with the governing
  representatives of Constel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>After the ancient civil war that led to the
  split with Kendaria, Constel underwent a tremendous governmental change and
  became a democracy. Each town and city sends a representative to Lentira,
  where the representatives negotiate legislation on behalf of their
  constituents.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Constel exports tremendous amounts of timber and
  finished wooden products, along with clay goods and philosophical ideas.
  Constel trades locally with both Kendaria and Forsten and conducts maritime
  trade with Derk. While Forsten and Kendaria both used to be part of a single
  nation along with Constel, the Constelines do not generally begrudge either
  nation and try to foster strong alliances with both.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>The Consteline standing army is quite small and ill-trained.
  Constel relies on a strong alliance with both Kendaria and Forsten to protect
  its southern and northern borders, while the Dreamhaze Mountains protect its
  west and the ocean its east.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Most Constelines are not particularly religious. While the
  Kendarians and Forsteners think that the Old Forest should be respected and
  paid almost a supernatural reverie, Constelines tend to be more pragmatic and
  do not think much of using the forest for an abundance of timber.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Constelines are usually amicable but reserved. They will make
  small talk with virtually anyone, but are hesitant to make lasting
  friendships.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>A large crime syndicate called the Constellation attempts
  to undermine Constel’s current regime. Members of the Constellation believe an
  ancient prophecy that cutting down the Old Forest will spell doom for those
  who condone such behavior, and they engage in cult-like destruction of
  governmental property and sabotage of mercantile supply roads.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LENTIRA</b></h3>
<p>
  The shining capital city of Constel overlooks the eastern sea, about a day and
  a half north of Kendaria’s capital when the wind is in your sails. Lentira has
  a splendid university, several theatres, a sporting stadium, and famously
  large gardens where students and philosophers might relax or contemplate life.
  Its governmental buildings are constructed from hewn marble, and many of its
  other buildings are made of fine stone and polished wood.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Dreamhaze Mountains. </b>The mountains that overlook the Old Forest are
  known as the Dreamhaze Mountains, so named because of the strange, dreamlike
  quality evoked by their misty slopes. It’s very easy to become lost in the
  Dreamhaze Mountains, even for skillful trackers, so most just avoid the
  mountains altogether. Those who do journey into the mountains often find
  inexplicable runes, come face to face with incarnations of their old memories,
  and must contend with strange monsters they have never heard of.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Old Forest. </b>The Old Forest sprawls across most of Kendaria and
  Forsten, and was once a major feature of Constel as well. While monster
  sightings are rare in these picturesque woods, travelers and locals alike are
  often left with a vague sense of unease after hiking therein. Children tell
  each other ghost stories that seem a little too real, somehow, and even
  skilled hunters have occasionally gone missing with no explanation. Although
  much of the Old Forest in Constel has been chopped down, these feelings of
  unease persist even when people spend time where the forest used to loom.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>

</h2>
<p>
  Derk is a rocky and hilly country blanketed in the west by a sprawling pine
  forest. With mild summers and frigid winters, Derk suffers the brunt of the
  arctic winds rolling down from the north. Its stony hills and cold forests
  make agricultural practice difficult, so Derk largely relies on pastoral
  farming inland and fishing along the coastline.
</p>
<br />

  style="width: 390px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Derk has a few small schools along its coastal cities, but
  these are significantly lacking in most contemporary scientific practices and
  philosophical thought. Most Derkese that live inland do not receive a formal
  education.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Derk has a classical feudal model with a
  monarch whose eldest child takes their place when they die. Lords and ladies
  oversee regions, and individual towns and communities are run by mayors. Each
  mayor can levy a small militia from their town. The Derkese monarchy -
  currently ruled by Erwin Derk II - is nationally weak and is not very
  successful at enforcing cooperation from lords or mayors.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Derkese sailors trade regularly with Forsten,
  Constel, and Kendaria to the south as well as Yodvan to the north. Overland,
  Derk primarily trades with Forsten.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Derk’s military is strongest along the coast, with several
  dozen naval ships sailed by ferocious warriors. Their military is much weaker
  in the forested lands to the west, and towns in this region are often subject
  to raids from Bishal.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Derkese religious practice revolves around the Stravon
  Conclave of the Archfae. By worshiping the Conclave that embodies emotional
  states, the Derkese place an emphasis on being fully true to one’s own
  emotional reaction to an experience and what lessons one might learn from
  that.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Towns in Derk’s inland tend to be down-to-earth, honest folk.
  They are hospitable but guarded around strangers, and if strangers prove to be
  trustworthy then they will be welcomed as one of the town’s own. Along the
  coast, Derkese society is a little more vibrant and one or more theatres for a
  wide variety of performing arts are common in each city.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Small gangs work to ship illicit goods in and out of Derk’s
  ports, but there is no centralized criminal authority. Derk’s poorly organized
  town guards are helpless to stop these smugglers.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ICEPOINT AND WHITEBREAK</b></h3>
<p>
  The capital of Derk is not actually its largest city. Icepoint is a stony
  fortress on the northern coast from which the reigning monarch decrees laws
  and settles disputes, so it is technically the capital. However, Derk’s
  largest city is Whitebreak.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Nestled in a cove along the southern side of the peninsula and so named
  because of the large waves that break into white foam against the cliffs
  around the bay, Whitebreak is home to a massive port. Whitebreak is
  responsible for over half of Derk’s whole economy. As such, the lord of
  Whitebreak often treats the monarch with an ironic deference in public and
  bullies the monarch in private.

  <b>DOSHAIRIEL</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Doshairiel is quite a large nation, sprawling along the northeastern side of
  the Cloudpiercer Mountains. The nation is almost entirely covered in temperate
  forest, but is wide enough from north to south that different regions
  experience quite different summers. Southern Doshairiel, primarily deciduous,
  has muggy summers with frequent thunderstorms and mild winters with occasional
  rain and sleet. The north of the nation, more boreal than deciduous, has dry,
  mild summers and snowy winters.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Doshairiel"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961611/RPzji3vppWeucJ3gqNjUIg/original.png?1771159304"
  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Doshairiel is one of the oldest nations on Gathandia, having been founded by
  the star elves before the events of written history. As elves are long-lived
  and can communicate with one another in their dreams, Doshairiel has a
  complicated and highly functional governmental system. While star elves and
  forest elves are both highly populous in Doshairiel, the nation is home to
  many lineages from across the continent.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Virtually every settlement in Doshairiel has some kind of
  school. The larger cities, naturally, will have well-funded universities, as
  opposed to the single-room lecture halls that one might find in a small
  village. Education is mandatory for children, but optional for teens, who
  might choose to apprentice themselves to a master of a particular trade
  instead. Those who continue their formal education are more likely to become
  governors or oligarchs.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Doshairiel does not have an aristocracy.
  Instead, an oligarchy of fifteen elders oversees the happenings of the nation,
  delegating responsibilities to regional governors. These oligarchs each choose
  their heirs and choose when to step down from office, promoting their heirs to
  become the next oligarch in their stead.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Doshairiel produces a bounty of timber,
  foodstuffs, and animal byproducts. In addition to trading internally,
  Doshairieli merchants also trade with Betaal and whoever they can safely reach
  via the Inner Ocean. They also trade with Falth, though successful merchants
  that do so are careful not to get swindled or sucked into a blackmail scheme
  with one of the crime lords.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Doshairiel’s military is centralized and commanded by
  generals appointed by the oligarchy. Its military commanders study philosophy
  and magical practices as much as military theory, implementing both knowledge
  bases into their training regimens and combat techniques. Doshairieli
  soldiers, especially those stationed near the Inner Sea where raids from
  Renden are common, are quite competent.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Given their heritage as a nation founded by star elves,
  Doshairieli ascribe great meaning to the patterns of the stars. Most religious
  scholars in Doshairiel associate certain constellations with Avatars and
  beings from the Celestial Council. Many also pay homage to Ancerra’s five
  moons and will have religious services any time there is a full moon.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Governors and town administrators are responsible for
  maintaining a delicate balance of free market and communist methodologies to
  keep the balance of wealth spread equally across their settlements.
  Doshairieli towns exact heavy taxes on their citizenry, keep a fraction of the
  profit for infrastructural advancement, and return the rest of the taxes to
  the town’s citizens in equal shares. This allows for one’s own financial
  advancement slowly over many years, and generally mitigates the worst effects
  of poverty. On the whole, Doshairieli folk are content with this system.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Doshairiel does not have an organized crime syndicate, but
  local gangs operate in the larger cities, mugging unfortunate passersby and
  running protection rackets. Powerful Falthic crime networks also have a
  presence in some Doshairieli cities and even in Starborea.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>STARBOREA, THE WORLD-TREE</b></h3>
<p>
  Looming miles tall above the rest of the forest, and even taller than some of
  the small peaks in the Cloudpiercer Range, the ancient World-Tree keeps its
  silent vigil. The World-Tree, known as Starborea, is indeed tall enough to
  scrape the clouds in the sky.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Visited from far and wide by pilgrims and tourists that wish to gaze upon its
  greatness, Starborea is also home to both the capital of Doshairiel and an
  independent city-state.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Shairea, the capital of Doshairiel, occupies the area on and around
  Starborea’s mighty roots. From Shairea, the oligarchy legislates and oversees
  the happenings of their nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Within the tree, Starborea is an independent city-state. A religious group
  known as the Celestial Cardinals reside in Starborea, overseeing the orthodox
  doctrine of all who worship the Celestial Council. There are always
  twenty-four Cardinals, who offer counsel and guidance to priests throughout
  Gathandia.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Besides the religious order, Starborea is a fully functioning city-state with
  its own militia, economy (they harvest sap and fungus grown in farms within
  the mighty tree), and governing officials. The governor of Starborea passes
  legislation for the city-state while deferring to the Cardinals on matters of
  great import. Starborea’s current governor is a star elf named Dencassan
  Briarye. Dencassan is quite elderly, even by elvish standards, and in his vast
  knowledge and wisdom he is very slow to act, taking painstaking amounts of
  time to deliberate on any decision.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Scholars and philosophers find the World-Tree endlessly fascinating, and some
  scholars have begun to develop theories that Starborea is in fact the parent
  plant to the other World-Trees found throughout Gathandia.

  <b>DYSPARA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The peoples of Dyspara are generally hospitable and down-to-earth. The natural
  climate is anything but. Dyspara is a harsh landscape of jagged, rocky deserts
  and rolling sand dunes. Along the coast, scant vegetation offers marginal
  relief from the scouring heat and sand-specked wind. Worst of all, far above
  this parched land, an enormous cube of water floats in the sky, tantalizingly
  out of reach. Dysparans have never been able to reach the water cube, so to
  access water they dig very deep wells and by desalinating ocean water.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Dyspara"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961602/9RYm9vybbcyLJxdlflGGLw/original.png?1771159302"
  style="width: 390px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Dyspara’s capital city has a small academy that has competent
  lectures on reading, arithmetic, and basic history, but struggles to attract
  any prestigious scholars.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic, Political, and Social. </b>Dyspara is functionally a tribal
  federation. Each tribe has a patriarch or matriarch who is elected to lead the
  tribe. These elders elect representatives who travel to Dyspara’s port city of
  Stemorna, where these representatives negotiate legislation that all of their
  representative tribes can abide by.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  With a few exceptions, Dysparan tribes are nomadic, following herds of
  leatherbacks and moving with the weather in an effort to find the most livable
  conditions for the season. Aside from Stemorna, Dyspara has a half-dozen
  tribes that live in permanent cities. These tribes welcome traveling tribes
  when they arrive, with the understanding that nomadic tribes will not reside
  in a city for more than a month at a time due to the strain that this puts on
  the city’s resources. Most Dysparans understand and respect the rules set
  forth by permanent cities and especially by Stemornan lawmakers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Dyspara exports semi-precious rocks and salt,
  which they trade with Ahten in exchange for foodstuffs. They also export sand
  to nations that wish to press sand bricks or make adobe structures. Stemorna
  has a large port that accepts international traders, although most other
  nations prefer to trade with one another and overlook Dyspara due to its lack
  of luxury goods.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Dysparan tribes each have a young warrior sect that keep
  their tribe safe from the fearsome creatures of the desert and from
  belligerent tribes. Dysparan warriors tend to be skilled at navigating desert
  terrain, but fight with weapons that other nations might consider primitive.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>As Dysparans can always see an abundance of water but never
  access it, their religious philosophies wrestle with the problem of scarcity
  and the question of why good people aren’t rewarded with good things. They
  largely arrive at the conclusion that the gods only care about themselves,
  leading them to other philosophical questions that Dysparan elders and monks
  often debate and teach.

<p>
  By any other nation’s standards, Stemorna is a small and struggling city. By
  Dyspara’s standards, it is a thriving metropolis. Stemorna has a small academy
  and a respectable port that can host international deep-sea vessels. It also
  houses the congressional halls of Dyspara’s representatives sent from the

  <b>ERYNDOR</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Eryndor stands as a bulwark between the horrors of a haunted forest and the
  rest of the nations of Gathandia. Eryndor’s military maintains a massive wall
  that runs from north to south. East of the wall, Nachtskog - the Black Forest
  - spawns all manner of nightmarish monsters, which Eryndor’s valiant knights
  turn away time and again.
</p>
<br />
<img

  style="width: 426px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Eryndor’s climate includes mild summers and snowy, long winters. While the
  nation is reasonably prosperous, Roshallan has made no effort to conquer
  Eryndor, for it serves as a buffer against the haunts of Nachtskog.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Brightguard has a sizable university, and several of
  Eryndor’s notable towns and smaller cities have formal academies as well. Most
  small towns have a local teacher who tutors children, but formal education is
  not structured as rigorously as it is in larger towns or in Brightguard.
  Eryndor readily accepts international scholars to reside at its schools when
  such opportunities arise.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Eryndor uses a republic as its governing
  system. A chancellor is elected by representatives who must vote in accordance
  with the wishes of their constituency. The chancellor then works with
  legislators from each of Eryndor’s districts to pass laws and maintain social
  order. Chancellors rule for eight years at a time and can be reelected.
  Eryndor’s current chancellor, an earth elemental named Bismarck “the Boulder”
  Densworth, is in his fifth term as Chancellor of the nation. While he lacks
  charisma, he is a decisive military leader and has kept the Great Wall very
  well maintained.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Eryndor generally does not concern itself with
  international trade, making an exception for Ruptaea as a reliable overland
  neighbor that has not exhibited aggression towards Eryndor or other nations.
  Eryndor’s forests and pastures produce bountiful crops, livestock, and timber.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Eryndor has a large and disciplined military. Some of the
  military occupies the southern border to guard against aggression from
  Roshallan, while most of the rest maintain the Great Wall to Eryndor’s
  northeast. This wall predates the nation, built in a previous supereon, but
  the Eryndorans obsessively maintain the wall. Nightmarish monsters from
  Nachtskog lead regular, vicious attacks against the fortification with utmost
  hostility to the country’s citizens.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Eryndor’s military often coordinates with Skavr’s, as the two nations both
  suffer from the monstrous attacks that come from the haunted woods.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Knights of Eryndor are the military elite. Skillful both on the
  battlefield and as rangers in the woodlands, the Knights train rigorously and
  are inspirational to all who fight beside them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Viewing themselves as the last line of defense against the
  horrors of Nachtskog, Eryndorans view themselves with a sense of holy pride.
  Their patron goddess, Rasheen, is believed to prowl the planes of existence to
  vanquish burgeoning threats. The Eryndorans often lead military expeditions
  into the woods near Nachtskog, which takes on religious significance for many
  soldiers and their families.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Most Eryndorans are earnest, duty-oriented folk. From farmers
  to soldiers to politicians, the average Eryndoran views their job with a
  seriousness that other nationalities might find excessive. To the Eryndorans,
  each person offers an important contribution to the fight against the horrors
  of Nachtskog.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>While most Eryndorans view their place in the world as
  valiant knights against the forces of darkness, there are some who - for any
  number of reasons - are disillusioned with Eryndor or the world at large.
  These folk often form secretive cults that declare the glory of the monsters
  from Nachtskog and try to undermine the defenses of the Great Wall.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>BRIGHTGUARD</b></h3>
<p>
  Eryndor’s shining capital city, Brightguard is a thriving port city built on
  the mouth of the Eryndor River. A sizable port allows for trade with other
  nations in the Inner Sea, though Eryndor’s merchant vessels are not heavily
  armed enough to safely sail into Renden waters.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Brightguard’s Republic Palace is a large building made of fortified stone and
  military buildings on the outside and plush, luxurious trappings deep in the
  interior complex of buildings. From this building, the chancellor guides the
  nation.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>

  Nachtskog is a swathe of blighted and haunted woodlands. Home to hag covens,
  fiends that made it through portals from Inferno, and all manner of horrifying
  creatures, Nachtskog is a deadly place and its savage progeny often rush forth
  to attack the Great Wall. With gnarled branches black against the sky,
  Nachtskog’s World-Tree is a twisted and hideous facsimile of the lifegiving
  world-trees found in other nations. Like the World-Trees in Muskshir and on
  the border of Sozein and Tafunga, this World-Tree’s roots connect back to the
  original World-Tree: Starborea in Doshairiel.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>FALTH</b></h2>
<p>
  A federation of large cities sprawling from the lowest, most navigable point
  in the Cloudpiercer Range to the coast of the Inner Sea, the vast majority of
  Falth’s cities are run by mafiosos and criminal kingpins.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  Falth generally shares the natural climate of southern Doshairiel: deciduous
  forests, humid summers, and rainy winters. Falth is rockier and hillier than
  most of Doshairiel, and the easternmost reaches of Falth - through the
  Cloudpiercer Pass - are scrubby desertland that receive little rain year on
  year.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Many of Falth’s cities fund universities or academies. The
  crime lords that run the cities typically believe that an educated citizenry
  will lead to more economic prosperity, even if it does come with potential
  threats to their power.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Each of Falth’s cities are run autonomously
  by crime families. The larger families, along with those that have
  intermarried, control two or more cities that almost function as miniature
  nations within the Falthic federation. Falth is primarily held into cohesion
  due to shared cultural history and the mob bosses’ mutual respect for one
  another. While one mafioso would order another one dead without hesitation,
  that does not mean that they do not admire each other’s clever political
  machinations and see one another as respected rivals.

<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Falth’s rocky foothills near the Cloudpiercer
  Mountains produce a healthy amount of precious metals and gems. Farther to the
  west, the forested regions of Falth offer lumber and plant and animal
  byproducts. Fiercely capitalistic crime lords will compete with one another to
  sell their goods on the international black market.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Given Falth’s central location in the middle of Gathandia, many merchants find
  it difficult to get from the east to the west and back without traveling
  through Falth. Most mob bosses allow safe passage through their towns in
  exchange for hefty tolls.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Each crime lord maintains a private army of thugs, spies, and
  assassins. Those that prove incompetent are quickly disposed of, and even
  common grunts know that they play a dangerous game. Most crime lords put a
  good deal of resources towards buying out the thugs and spies that work for
  their rivals. If the price is right, and a spy becomes a double agent, it can
  be lucrative, but at the risk of death if they are discovered.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>While some Falthic commoners might hold religious beliefs,
  it is uncommon for anyone in Falth to act in obviously moral fashion. Those
  who do refrain from stealing, grifting, or conning are usually left behind. A
  few mafiosos practice religion, though it is hard to tell whether this is
  borne of true conviction or a desire to project an appearance of moral
  superiority.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social and Underworld. </b>Needless to say, even the lowliest Falthic
  commoner will not go out of their way to do favors for anyone unless something
  is in it for them. An act of pure, uncalculated altruism is as rare as a
  five-moon eclipse in this selfish land.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The one notable exception is the Gray Hoods. Led by former members of the
  Hoods syndicate in Thunderhead Vale, the Gray Hoods use all of the
  unscrupulous methods of typical Falthic mobs, but they use these methods in an
  effort to build a better society. They steal from crime lords and give money
  to the needy, trying to foster a sense of goodwill among the common folk. When
  possible, they leap at the opportunity to assassinate a corrupt leader and try
  to replace them with one that has at least some measure of scruples.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DIRGE</b></h3>
<p>
  Felson Weskh, a cunning polar urkou, is widely regarded as the most powerful
  and influential crime lord in all of Falth. His city, Dirge, is the largest in
  Falth and straddles both a lucrative mine and the main road that traverses the
  Cloudpiercer Pass. Dirge is miles wide and also covers many rocky hillsides
  that stretch west of the Cloudpiercer foothills. Felson deviously manipulates
  the lesser crime lords, ensuring that they fight one another rather than
  challenging his authority over this vital region. He has designs on uniting
  some of the least ambitious crime lords into an organized nation, from which
  he will springboard his conquest of the surrounding nations, beginning with
  Nalathesh.

  <b>FJORDENHAVEN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  If not for the volcanic activity, Fjordenhaven would not likely exist.
  Sulfurous hot springs and lava flows provide warmth enough to maintain a
  boreal climate despite the scouring, frigid winds that sweep down from the
  north pole.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Fjordenhaven"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961622/pMohM3Iot_s8vySsZAL07A/original.png?1771159306"
  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Fjordenhaven developed along these hot springs, making great use of the heat
  to produce both agriculture and energy for industry. The hot spots beneath the
  surface of the earth extend up a chain of craggy islands, and Fjordenhaven has
  inhabited all of these islands capable of supporting vegetation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Fjordenhaven’s architecture is simple, with stone foundations and walls and
  steep wood-shingled roofs. They commonly decorate their entryways with
  scrimshaw carvings or decorative caribou antler displays.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Fjordenhaven’s capital has a large library with conference
  rooms and study halls, but does not have formal education. Mystics and
  historians pass on their wisdom orally, traveling from town to town sharing
  their knowledge.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Fjordenhaven is a traditional monarchy, the
  heirship passing from eldest child to eldest child. The younger siblings of
  the monarch are assigned governing positions over various regions, towns, or
  industries. Its current monarch is King Alfur Svansson.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Fjordenhaven has a surprising number of wares to
  offer in international trade. They have a large shepherding community and
  industrial textile mills that process wool into fine cloth. They also mine
  valuable minerals from the volcanic mountains.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Fjordenhaven maintains a few large caravels that make long voyages down
  Gathandia’s west coast, trading with Ruptaea, Vaenyth, and Pash.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Fjordenhaven’s folk are hardened by the adversity of long,
  cold winters. The Fjordenhavian military is small but strong, and they
  maintain several fortified outposts along the mainland’s coast and their
  islands.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Like many northern folk, the Fjordenhavian are fascinated by
  the northern lights. They believe it to be a manifestation of the Celestial
  Council’s will, and believe that when it appears in the sky, its colors and
  the sequence in which they appear foretell different events to come.
  Fjordenhavian priests interpret these signs, and the monarchy usually acts
  based on these predictions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Fjordenhavians punish crime with swift and decisive harshness.
  A thief might have their hand chopped off and exiled from their town. If they
  are given no reason to be suspicious, however, the common folk are usually
  very warm to visitors from other towns and other nations.

  <b>The Frostvale. </b>A wide valley between two icy mountain ranges, the
  Frostvale is a massive graveyard. Divided into a miles-wide plot of land for
  the common folk, a sizeable plot for warriors that fell in battle, and
  cavernous mausoleums for deceased monarchs, Fjordenhavians visit the Frostvale
  when they wish to pay respects to any of their ancestors. Rumor has it that

  the ground. Their bodies, preserved in the frozen earth, will stand ready to

</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Ice Chapel. </b>Chiseled out of the glacier facing north from the end
  of the western mountain range bordering the Frostvale, the Ice Chapel is
  considered a holy observatory from which Fjordenhavians can pay tribute to the
  Celestial Council. The acoustics in the glacial chapel make singing take on a
  wondrous, ethereal quality, and the ice is so thin on the walls high above
  that observers can see through it to observe the stars and the aurora.

  <b>FORSTEN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Forsten exists almost entirely within the Old Forest. With mild summers and
  cold winters that often bring snow, the folk of Forsten are a tough lot. Most
  treat the forest with deep respect and a little fear.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Forsten"

  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Once a single kingdom along with Constel and Kendaria, Forsten has only
  seceded from Constel within the past couple generations. The oldest folk of
  Forsten would remember the days when it was the northern half of a larger
  kingdom, though virtually none living today would recall it being one with
  Kendaria, which split away after a civil war several hundred years hence.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Most Forsteners place more stock in one’s ability to chop
  timber or skin game than in their ability to recite poetry. Formal education
  is uncommon, but entertainers do hold a special place in society as they spin
  fanciful tales long after the sun has set.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Forsten is a troubled nation. Having only
  been its own autonomous country for a few score years, many burgomasters of
  middling towns feel that they are qualified to manage the entire nation.
  Although the young dwarf Janice Magillory is nominally the queen of Forsten,
  she commands little respect and has been unable to cajole other political
  figures into following her leadership.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Although its relationship with Constel is still
  quite tender, Forsten maintains a trade relationship with its neighbor. Many
  Forsten merchants are also sailors and trade with Kendaria to the south and
  Derk to the north. Brusch Clydesden, a renowned urkou explorer in his early
  life and skilled long-distance trader now that he is getting on in years, will
  occasionally guide a merchant vessel as far north as Yodvan.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Forsten primarily exports timber, although some of the locals fear that
  deforestation will anger the ancient gods of the Old Forest, as they believe
  happened in Constel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Forsteners tend to be a strong, sturdy lot and make competent
  fighters. Many hunters, lumberjacks, fishers, and long-distance merchants have
  had to fight off numerous monstrosities from the untamed stretches of the Old
  Forest. Janice Magillory wants to establish a national army, but has been
  unable to rally support for such a movement.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Forsteners are quite spiritual and often superstitious. Many
  believe that small actions will have unforeseen consequences and worry about
  the wrath of the old gods. Most will pray to multiple pantheons, but
  especially the Shibmar Conclave of the Archfae.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Forsten is not a particularly hospitable region. Fear of the
  forest has led many to treat strangers with suspicion or outright hostility,
  even if the strangers are just from another town in Forsten.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Due to Janice Magillory’s utter failure to unite her
  country, crime syndicates flourish in the underbellies of all major cities in
  Forsten. Smugglers traffic weapons, gems, and drugs in and out of their
  nation, and mercenaries will take any protection or assassination job for the
  right price.

<p>
  A land riddled with natural disasters and monsters, Gavare’s hostile
  environment has bred a resilient and warlike population. Gavare straddles the
  southern Cloudpiercer Range - where the mountains are considerably easier to
  navigate - and occupies the land around most of the Smoldering Canyon. Common
  natural disasters in this land include sulfurous gas spraying into the air
  from the canyon, sandstorms whipping up in the desert, rockslides from the
  mountains, earthquakes thanks to a large fault line, and monsoons that batter
  the Gavarese states east of the Cloudpiercers.
</p>

  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Gavarese folk have traditionally believed that engaging in frequent ritual
  warfare with one another will appease the gods responsible for these natural
  disasters. Many are ready to move on from such beliefs, but the monarchs and
  high priests are reluctant to abandon tradition.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Scholarly arcanists in Gavare are fascinated by the
  Smoldering Canyon and are trying to convince the ruling elite to abolish the
  ritual wars and harness the magical energy within the Smoldering Canyon. This
  social transition has thus far been unsuccessful.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Gavare has eleven major states. Each is
  ruled by a monarch. Some such monarchs are also the high priests of their
  state, while other states separate the responsibilities of governance and
  religious leadership. These monarchs frequently negotiate trade agreements
  with one another and if threatened by a foreign entity will rally together.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>At the behest of arcanist scholars in the nation,
  some Gavarese tribes have begun to mine the Smoldering Canyon for its precious
  metals. They have also established an ongoing trade relationship with Ahten,
  who pays high premiums to mine the Canyon in Gavare’s territory. Gavare and
  Thaaj trade frequently, especially the states of Gavare that can offer timber
  from east of the Cloudpiercers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant, Religious, and Social. </b>The nine states on the west of the
  Cloudpiercers, occupying the land around the Smoldering Canyon, engage in
  ritual warfare with one another. This is done to appease their destructive
  pantheon of gods, whom they believe destroy the world every hundred years.
  Given Gavare’s high volume of natural disasters, the Gavarese see these
  disasters as acts from the divine.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The two states that live to the east of the Cloudpiercers share the same
  religious beliefs, but this manifests in battle against the monstrosities that
  lurk in the Kozia Rainforest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Most Gavarese worship gods out of fear, rather than gratitude. The Ashyidir
  Conclave of the Archfae, the Corrupted Avadri, the Fiends of Inferno, and the
  Exiles are commonly worshiped as they seem most likely to be responsible for
  frequent natural disasters.

  <b>GETAR</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Getar is an island nation with a strange geological makeup. The nation is
  three concentric ring-shaped islands: the smallest island, directly in the
  middle, is entirely industrialized and is home of their capital. The middle
  island forms a ring around the inner island, and likewise, the outer island
  forms a ring around the other two. Although there are natural variations in
  the islands’ coastal shapes, the overall appearance of the three islands is
  that of two rings, one larger and one smaller, both enveloping a dot.
</p>

  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Most Getarese feel that this geological makeup would have been impossible if
  not for the involvement of some kind of remarkably advanced gods and they
  worship the technology-driven deities known as the Avadri.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Getar used to be a powerful nation in the Inner Sea, but after Roshallan
  defeated Chee and commandeered its navy, they swept across the Inner Sea and
  smashed Getar’s military. They have let Getar maintain its theocratic way of
  governance in public, but in private, the theocrats are controlled by
  Roshallani militants.

<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Most Getarese receive a mixed education. Cultivation of
  intelligence is highly valued in Getarese culture, so students usually learn a
  mixture of language skills, math, and history, but the focus is usually placed
  on science. Having discovered two strange minerals - Avadrium and Arcanium -
  in their shallow lakes, the Getarese enthusiastically pursue experimentation
  with these materials.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Political and Religious. </b>Getar is a theocratic society. From the
  capital city of Pount, the Theocrats purportedly receive cryptic visions from
  the Avadri beyond and translate these mysteries into actionable policy.
  Citizens of Getar are expected to comply with these proclamations as both
  political and religious truth. In fact, now that Getar is controlled by
  Roshallan, the Theocrats simply do what Roshallani commanders order them to
  do.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Under the Roshallani Empire, Getar has become a
  valuable mining nation for the greater empire. They export their Avadrium and
  Arcanium to Roshallan’s mainland in exchange for undervalued compensation and
  the ongoing right to live on their own land.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant and Underworld. </b>Weakened rebel forces engage in guerilla
  warfare against Roshallan, but to little avail. A network of Getarese thieves
  and saboteurs coordinate with the rebels of Chee in an effort to bring down
  the Roshallani.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Before Roshallan’s occupation, most Getarese saw one another
  through a vague caste lens. The citizens of the outermost ring were considered
  the peasantry, and those on the innermost ring the nobles. Now that Roshallan
  has conquered Geter, most Getarese citizens see one another as victimized
  siblings and try to look out for their neighbors when able.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POUNT</b></h3>
<p>
  The innermost island of Getar, its capital city, is home to the great temple
  of the Theocracy. This temple functions as both a religious center and a
  legislative hall.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Pount also has large industrial facilities where Avadrium and Arcanium are
  systematically processed and purified before being exported by the Roshallani
  navy. Well-equipped research facilities on the island are also staffed by
  renowned alchemists looking for new applications of these materials.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Getarese want to recruit the heroes to help them covertly battle the
    Roshallani. Will the heroes join the side of the beleaguered rebels?
  </li>
  <li>
    The Theocracy and/or leading scholars from the Getarese want the heroes to
    conduct some experiments with an Avadrium-Arcanium alloy. The resulting
    reaction teleports the heroes into the Celestial Sea, with no obvious way
    back…
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>HADLA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A quiet, uneventful, and unremarkable nation, Hadla can be the perfect place
  for retired heroes to spend the remainder of their years in undisturbed peace.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Hadla"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475961606/gLAHoi-aCbgheu3ViIyLxQ/original.png?1771159304"
  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  With steamy, rainy summers and damp, rainy winters, Hadla’s fertile soil can
  produce crops virtually year-round. The jungles that occupy its southwest can
  be dangerous, so younger would-be adventurers looking to make a name for
  themselves often head into the jungle looking for trouble. The rest of the
  nation, where most of its population resides, is quite peaceful and little
  ever seems to happen.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Bundimor has a large library, and most of the major cities
  and towns in Hadla have some form of library or school center. There are no
  major universities or academies in Hadla, so most scholarly information is
  passed down orally or ignored as unimportant.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Hadla operates on a traditional feudal
  model. The monarch delegates certain regions to the dukes and duchesses, who
  divide their regions into vassal states run by counts and settlements overseen
  by barons. Hadla’s current monarch is Queen Magya VI, who commands respect
  from the other nobles and of whom the common folk hold almost no opinion,
  positive or negative.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>There are few natural resources of much worth in
  the nation aside from some pigment dyes that can be extracted from plants in
  the jungle. Capable of sustaining itself on its own food supply, Hadla’s
  economy primarily functions from inter-settlement trade, but some merchant
  caravans will occasionally journey north across a small mountain range to
  trade with Nalathesh. Others will descend into the Great Chasm to trade with
  Vadan and Unjaarn. Trade with Tafunga is very rare due to the undeveloped
  nature of the Hadlan jungle. There are no well-maintained roads and only a few
  outpost towns in this region.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>As is traditionally the case of feudal nations, there is not
  a nationalized military. Instead, each noble has a small private militia that
  they can levy on their own behalf to quell bandits, or on behalf of their
  superiors when the dukes or monarchs fear that a neighboring nation might take
  interest in invading Hadla. All of the combined levied soldiers of Hadla would
  be unlikely to stave off an invasion, but none of Hadla’s neighboring nations
  have much interest in conquering them as they have little in the way of
  valuable resources.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Hadlans commonly worship the Celestial Council and the
  Stravon Conclave of the Archfae. Many Hadlans hold the belief that it can’t
  hurt to try to appease every deity, so many households have whittled
  likenesses of dozens of deities scattered throughout their houses and on their
  mantles.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Hadlan society usually has some minor holiday coming up. With a
  focus on cycles of emotion, cycles of the seasons, and the cycle of life and
  death, every few weeks there will be a festival of one kind or another
  celebrating these states of existence.

</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>BUNDIMOR</b></h3>
<p>
  The capital of Hadla overlooks the second-largest of the nation’s lakes. The
  monarch’s palace is a traditional stone castle with a large enough public park
  inside its courtyard that all of the capital city’s residents could live there
  in times of siege. Other than this impressive castle, Bundimor is just a
  larger version of any other Hadlan town: wooden homes, shingled or thatched

  <b>HUSK</b>
</h2>
<p>
  By all mundane metrics, Husk should not exist as a nation. Its desert
  landscape is predominantly rocks and pebbles and there are no noteworthy areas
  that could function as arable farmland. In fact, chunks of pebbly landscape
  have been known to spontaneously levitate for a time before showering down on
  whomever is so unlucky as to be standing beneath.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Husk"

  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  And this unexplainable phenomenon is what gives Husk its appeal. When
  prospective settlers traversed across this strange and hostile land, they were
  fascinated by the magical phenomena that they witnessed. Defying logic, they
  built a city-state in the most stable land of the region and began studying
  these strange events. The formative years of Husk were brutal and deadly, but
  Husk now thrives as a city-state that attracts scholars and adventurers the
  world over.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Husk boasts a large university dedicated specifically to the
  study of magic and how the different Sources of Magic interact with one
  another. It was at the Husk Institute that a scholarly Bhrunai named Zitvin
  discovered that certain Sources of Magic, when applied in equal force against
  one another, trump each other like a five-way game of Rock, Paper, Scissors:
  each Source is stronger than two others, and weaker than two others.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Although it was originally a small
  community of a few curious researchers, as generations progressed, the
  ruthless Licten family took over by force and has ruled Husk ever since. The
  Lictens purport that they are the chosen of the Lumen Cloud, one of the
  strange magical phenomena of the area.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When a new Licten is ready to assume the throne of Husk, they journey into the
  desert to be claimed by the Cloud. Thus far, every Licten who has done so has
  returned with a mark as though struck by lightning, cementing their belief
  that they are divinely chosen.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Husk imports a vast majority of its foodstuffs,
  water, textiles, and basic raw materials. Capable manufacturers turn these raw
  materials into finished products, often infusing these items with minor
  magical properties. Husk was the first nation to commodify magical items and
  still dominates the international magic item trade. In addition to magic
  items, Huskan merchants sell bottled ambient magic with unpredictable effects.
  Careless travelers will be scammed and sold empty glass vials.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Husk has some of the fiercest infantry fighters in all
  Gathandia, but the Huskan army is so small that this does not actually mean
  much. Trained to fight with unique magical weapons, each elite warrior crafts
  their own magic weapon at the end of their training. While their army is
  small, it is nonetheless strong enough to dissuade any other nation from
  invading Husk.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The Lumen Cloud is the god of the region, and the Licten
  family is its chosen emissary to sapient creatures. The Lumen Cloud is a great
  glowing cumulus cloud that appears at random times over the region. When it is
  visible, normal daily affairs halt and the citizens of Husk praise the Cloud
  and pray that it bestows its everlasting power upon their nation and their
  beloved Licten family. The Cloud is especially spectacular to behold at sunset
  when it catches rays from the setting sun and magnifies its own glowing
  properties, or at nighttime when it refracts the silver light of the stars.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Because they live in a region that experiences frequent chaotic
  magical occurrences, the folk of Husk tend to be both cautious and
  unflappable. Having seen many strange things, they accept each new ripple of
  magic with almost disinterested stoicism.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>The Licten family has failed to crush multiple criminal
  organizations that smuggle magic items and bottled ambient magic out of the
  region to sell at black market prices to other adventurers and merchants.

  <b>KANDIFF</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The steppes of Kandiff, although quite dry, are nonetheless temperate and a
  reasonably pleasant environment in which to live. The summers are warm and
  arid, the winters chilly and often snowy. Kandiff is a land of mediocrity: it
  is not so mountainous as Betaal to the west, not so fertile as Bishal to the
  east, and not so magical or wealthy as Husk or Lesmishan to the south. It is,
  ironically, this very mediocrity that allows Kandiff to thrive: if its ground
  were as fertile or its mines as valuable as its neighbors, it might have been
  conquered long ago.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Kandif"

  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Most Kandiffese value education but do not have the means to
  pursue it in any serious way. Local schools will teach children the basics of
  reading and writing, but few pursue a scholarly career.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Kandiff’s two largest industries are ranching and
  mining. Ranchers breed cattle throughout most of Kandiff, though in the
  western foothills, ranchers also raise herds of sheep and goats. The miners
  generally live in the east of the nation, extracting minerals from the Great
  Chasm.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Kandiff’s largest mining export is actually salt, which other nations will pay
  a high premium to acquire.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>The town guard in each settlement is responsible for keeping
  the peace and protecting Kandiff’s citizens from any monsters. When needed,
  ranchers are usually competent auxiliaries to the town guard and are sometimes
  better fighters in the wilderness than the guards themselves. Although the
  combined forces of each town and city is not significant compared to
  neighboring nations, it is generally enough to keep neighboring forces from
  invading.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Political. </b>Kandiff is a federal oligarchy. Towns and cities are divided
  into provinces, each of which elect a single representative. Together, there
  are nine representatives that serve as the Oligarchs. They pass national and
  regional legislation and assign executors and judges to oversee the laws of
  the land.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Given the importance of horses in Kandiffese culture, most
  folk worship the archfae A’rl’ng, god of equine beasts, as the patron of
  Kandiff. Horses and other equine creatures are treated with great respect.
  Many households have horseshoes nailed over their doorframes. Many also
  worship Immort, the turtle god, out of respect for their living capital city.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Many try to embody the spiritual aspects of A’rl’ng and Immort
  in their daily lives. Both deities profess a philosophy of not worrying too
  much about the trials of life. A’rl’ng champions throwing off the shackles of
  strife, while Immort offers the assurance that one day things will sort
  themselves out. Kandiffese towns are quite hospitable and have festivals with
  the change of each season.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Bandits live in the steppes between towns, and occasionally
  bandit groups will join together to pose a real threat to a city, but the
  guards and ranchers have thus far been able to quell such bandit uprisings.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>APAKKU</b></h3>
<p>
  The only truly remarkable aspect of Kandiff is its capital city. Apakku is an
  ancient alligator snapping turtle who has grown to be the size of a small
  mountain. Having grown up in the dusty streams of northern Kandiff, the turtle
  observed the humanoids in her region and grew to love their homey attitudes.
  As she grew to be the size of a horse, then of a house, her fame spread
  throughout Kandiff. She traveled from province to province, contentedly
  observing children at play and ranchers and miners hard at work.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Finally, when Apakku grew old enough to be the size of a large hill, she
  telepathically commanded the Kandiffese to rebuild their oligarchic capital on
  her shell. For a hundred years now, she has continued to grow, and Kandiff’s
  capital city has grown with Apakku as her shell accommodates more and more
  buildings. She travels across Kandiff from north to south and from east to
  west three times annually, bringing the Oligarchy with her to ensure that all
  in their nation are well.

<p>
  A monarchic queendom with very old roots, Kendaria is generally viewed as a
  peaceful nation. An old forest sprawls across most of the nation, with towns
  and hamlets nestled in and around the forest’s hills and dales.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  Kendaria occupies a temperate climate with warm, rainy summers and mild
  winters. The mountain range to Kendaria’s west will usually get snow caps, and
  while snow will occasionally fall in the Old Forest, it almost never sticks
  for more than a day.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This tranquil appearance hides fresh wounds and old superstitions, however.
  Queen Astaria Gillian III, whose family has ruled for several hundred years,
  only recently raised the nation out of a destructive civil war between three
  of her vassals. With a just and cunning reputation, Queen Astaria maintains
  popular support among most of her citizens, although there are whispers that
  she was only able to maintain her hold over Kendaria thanks to the help of a
  dark eldritch beast.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Old Forest and the southern steppes hold some of the same undertones of
  menace. Although the forest and plains are both picturesque and monster
  sightings are uncommon, superstition abounds in both regions, and numerous
  tales of inexplicable activity fuel these superstitions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Kendaria is primarily an agrarian society, so formal
  education is not common. There will usually be one or two scholarly folk in a
  given settlement, who happily teach children reading, history, and arithmetic
  when they aren’t helping their parents in the fields or shops, but literacy is
  not particularly high in smaller towns. In the handful of proper cities
  throughout Kendaria, formalized schooling is more common.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Kendaria is a monarchic feudal nation
  implementing maternal primogeniture. As each eldest daughter of the Gillian
  house comes of age, her mother prepares her to become the next queen.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Landed gentry serve as dukes or duchesses over multiple towns, while each
  settlement is managed by a baron or baroness. Dukes and duchesses report to
  the queen’s court and serve as intermediaries between the monarch and the
  towns that they oversee.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Many of Kendaria’s internal roads between its
  towns - especially those networking the Old Forest - have fallen into a state
  of disrepair. This has proven a great challenge for many of the smaller
  hamlets that rely on inter-settlement trade to shore up their economies.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Kendaria maintains land trade with its closest neighbors, Constel to the north
  and the city-state of Bridgemoor to the west. In Bridgemoor, Kendarian
  merchants also do business with Nalatheshi traders regularly. By sea, Kendaria
  keeps trade arrangements with Forsten and Derk up the northern coast and will
  occasionally trade with Nenva, although
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Queen Astaria believes that spies from Nenva were responsible for starting the
  civil war that so damaged her country.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>In the wake of the civil war, Queen Astaria has begun to
  restructure Kendaria’s military: no longer do the gentry have the right to
  levy soldiers themselves, but instead they must entreat the monarchy to lend
  out some of its standing army in times of crisis. Queen Astaria’s top general,
  Ser Grendor, rigorously trains lieutenants to lead soldiers on both land and
  sea. While competent, the Kendarian national army is still quite small.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>As Kendarians tend to be superstitious, many are also very
  religious. Kendarian society relies heavily on the Old Forest for timber,
  fruits, and game, so Kendarian religious practices typically involve
  veneration of the Pashak Conclave of the Archfae and occasionally include
  prayers to the Celestial Council. On days or weeks of festivity, food
  offerings will often be burned in an effort to please the Pashak Conclave. As
  the Pashak represent vegetative life, the planting season in early spring is
  especially sacred to Kendarians.

<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Whispered conspiracies aside, Kendarians are usually a
  hospitable lot. As most settlements in the nation are on the smaller side,
  each person in a community usually knows most of their neighbors. When
  someone’s roof leaks after a summer thunderstorm, the community will often
  take time out of their day to pitch in and fix up the unlucky family’s
  rooftop. Kendarians view strangers and travelers with a mix of suspicion and
  rapt fascination.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Organized crime exists within the capital city and a couple
  of the other major cities, but these are isolated gangs that stake their claim
  over a few alleyways and marketplaces. The smaller communities have low crime
  rates and harsh punishments for thieves and miscreants.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>DALEWRIGHT</b></h3>
<p>
  The capital of Kendaria, Dalewright nestles in and around a couple rolling
  dales that drop into the eastern sea. The queen’s palace stands proud on the
  highest hill in the urban sprawl, and large marketplaces, zigzagging streets
  lined with townhomes, and theatres comprise most of the city’s makeup. The
  western neighborhood, closest to the Old Forest, has a large temple dedicated
  to the Archfae, and the northern quarter has a small university. The
  university’s library has many historical books, but its professors of more
  modern sciences such as alchemy and the theory of magic are a few decades
  behind the rest of the world.

  brown and withered in the fall.

<p>
  A dwindling shadow of a nation, Kess occupies a strip of land between the
  eastern mountains and the Great Chasm. It enjoys cloudy but pleasant weather
  aside from rather cold winters. Sadly, the otherwise enjoyable climate does
  little to cheer the nation’s absolutely impoverished denizens.

<p>
  After multiple revolutions scoured the once-forested nation, Palorva rose to
  power. As a vampire and practitioner of occult magic, her oppressed citizenry
  have no hope of her eventually dying. While she has grand designs on
  conquering the entire region around the Great Chasm, her nation’s crumbling
  economy has thus far prevented her from expanding.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Palorva ensures that the serfs that work her fields are too
  overworked and underfed to spend any energy on academic ventures. She has
  burned hundreds of books and replaced them with her own alternate history
  books, so those among the merchant caste who are able to read are told a very
  different historical account praising Palorva as a saintly hero.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Any person or family with a claim to
  aristocracy was impaled while still living and then slowly drained of blood.
  Those who are still alive and think they might have a claim to nobility make
  absolutely no such proclamations. Palorva’s word is law.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>The merchant caste of Kess is forced to keep set
  prices for their wares. No market competition is allowed under the watchful
  eye of Palorva. In order to bring more raw goods into Kess, Palorva is
  pursuing aggressive diplomatic negotiations with Forsten and Constel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Palorva is vigorously training her military so that she can
  wage war on nearby nations. As of yet, her soldiers are poorly equipped and
  regardless of their discipline they would be overpowered on the battlefield.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>No religious practice is allowed under Palorva’s regime, and
  all houses of worship have long since been burned to the ground. In private,
  many common folk entreat Tovare, Rasheen, and the whole Celestial Council for
  deliverance.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Kess is a strictly communist society, with Palorva and her
  secret police ensuring that wealth and resources are distributed with
  absolute, unyielding equality, household by household based on the number of
  residents living therein. This leads to untold suffering, and when possible,
  serfs and merchants will quietly offer one another the goods and services that
  they need to subsist. If the secret police find out, punishment is swiftly
  forthcoming.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>What passes as crime in Kess might pass as common decency
  in any other nation. In addition to secretly offering one another extra food
  and clothing as able, some among the serf and merchant caste are also planning
  a rebellion against Palorva.

  <b>LESMISHAN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Lesmishan is a wealthy nation sprawling along the lip of the Great Chasm.
  Having been founded a couple hundred years ago, it quickly became remarkably
  wealthy thanks to miners finding many veins of precious metals in the regions
  of the Great Chasm nearest their town. Lesmishan quickly grew from a single
  town to a nation of mining communities and trade outposts built precariously
  along the Great Chasm’s massive cliffs.
</p>
<br />
<img

  style="width: 402px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Lesmishan’s mighty banking guild - the
  Chasm Financing Co. - governs the nation. Each Lesmishanian town has a bank
  where representatives from the CFC choose a sheriff to keep order in the town
  and collect taxes for the CFC. The CFC will also loan out assets to people
  that they deem deserving. Both the bankers themselves and the citizens of any
  given town engage in wildly corrupt activity, but there are no written laws to
  enforce, so besides overt violence or resisting the CFC’s taxation, anything
  goes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Mining an abundance of gems, precious metals, and
  strange technologies, means that Lesmishan has vast trading capital. They
  trade widely with their neighboring nations and even distant nations in
  exchange for all manner of luxury goods and raw materials that they cannot
  naturally produce in their arid land. Lesmishan is especially known for a
  lightweight but rock-hard metal - called avadrium - that occasionally seems to
  glow in thin stripes and has been noted to enhance arcane and psionic power.

  <b>Militant. </b>Lesmishan has a well-funded standing militia, and most of the
  CFC hire private guards as well. Most Lesmishanian miners are also capable of
  combat and are very skilled in the rocky, cavernous territory of their home
  nation. Furthermore, due to Lesmishan’s tremendous wealth, most aggressors can
  be bought off for a low price, as earning just a few silver coins is better
  than risking violent combat in most people’s books.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Many miners in particular are religious or superstitious in
  some mix. Untold monsters do lurk in the caverns of the Great Chasm, and most
  miners will claim that they’ve seen unexplainable things. Many worship the
  Celestial Council or Avatars of protection and guidance. Others carry charms
  and trinkets to ward off evil spirits.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Lesmishan has a pretty bleak society. The rich hoard their
  wealth while the poor explore dangerous caverns in hopes of earning a little
  coin only to have it exorbitantly taxed by the bankers. Miners will often find
  that their friendships with one another are their only real solace in an
  otherwise unforgiving nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>There are likely secretive crime syndicates working in
  Lesmishan, both operated by Lesmishanians and by foreign operatives such as
  Nalathesh’s Sandsnakes. Most notably, of course, the bankers themselves
  operate much like a mafia.

  The capital of Lesmishan, a city by the same name, is the largest mining town

  deep in the caverns dotting the Chasm’s cliffs. While some mining still takes
  place there, most of the more shallow mineshafts have turned into black
  markets and criminal haunts. The city as a whole is wildly lawless and most
  miners spend far more than they earn in this city. The Chasm Financing Co.’s

  <b>MUSKSHIR</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Muskshir is a loose federation of several tribes that inhabit the stretch of
  jungle between the Great Chasm and the eastern sea. It has humid springs,
  monsoon summers that can reliably be predicted, dry falls, and mild, rainy
  winters.
</p>
<br />

  style="width: 420px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Some of the tribes in Muskshir are nomadic, moving from region to region with
  the change of the seasons. Most tribes are more or less stationary. Regardless
  of their approach, most buildings of any tribe are easy to deconstruct and
  reassemble elsewhere, which helps the Muskshiri avoid the worst of monsoon
  flooding. Some tribes build their permanent buildings in the tree canopies.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Largely uninterested in the pursuits of other nations,
  Muskshir does not have schools in the sense of buildings with books and tests.
  Instead, they have a rigorous apprenticeship system, with youth training under
  hunters, bakers, weavers, and the like to become experts in their crafts from
  a young age.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Although each tribe is self-governing, the
  Muskshiri share a culture and have historically all united into one when they
  feel their land is under threat. In such times, the leaders of each tribe will
  negotiate with one another and cast votes on the actions that their nation
  will pursue.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Tribal leaders are generally hereditary, with the eldest child of the leader
  becoming the new tribal leader when their parent passes on. Some tribes prefer
  a democratic election or a contest of strength, such as a wrestling
  tournament, to determine their next leader.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Muskshir usually just trades goods and services
  between Muskshiri tribes rather than with other nations. They produce a wide
  variety of plant-based goods, including valuable tinctures and salves, so
  alchemists and physicians pay top coin for Muskshiri herbs when a tribe does
  decide to trade with foreign merchants.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Most Mukshiri folk spend their entire lives in the jungle. As
  such, Muskshiri warriors are extremely competent in jungle warfare but are not
  very strong outside of familiar territory.

<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Muskshiri are usually welcoming of other tribes but suspicious

  tribal leaders and often are low-lethality.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Some Muskshiri tribal leaders are gradually working to

  so hushed speculations hold that the Godking is not one person, but many; the
  mask must surely be passed down from generation to generation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  On the whole, the Godking rules with a reasonably level hand, and so while
  taxes may be high most common folk are content with the system as it is.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Nalathesh tries to import as much academic talent as it can
  from other nations. Nalatheshi scholars eagerly learn from anyone who has news
  of the outside world or who might share new alchemical practices. The
  scholarly among Nalathesh are all part of a national guild dedicated to
  research, experimentation, and archiving of any magical item or creature that
  they can uncover. Nalatheshi scholars often live in developing towns alongside
  frontiersmen that delve into the Flesh Pit or the Chasm in search of treasure.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>The Godking makes every decision of
  substance in Nalathesh, and his will is enforced by his Radiant Princes. These
  are highly educated magic-using military commanders capable of serving on the
  battlefield or in a legislative hall as needed. Nalathesh’s godking is named
  Neferu, and while he is somewhat unpopular among the common folk, he has also
  made Nalathesh quite prosperous. His right hand man, General Tenemei, oversees
  the Radiant Princes. While Neferu is begrudgingly respected, General Tenemei
  is outright feared for his cruelty. Prominent nobles, including the Luxxor
  family, publicly support the current administration and privately pressure
  Neferu to remove Tenemei from power.

<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Nalathesh’s caravans of traders are very skilled
  at surviving in the desert, and so while fewer traders come to Nalathesh
  directly, many Nalatheshi caravans trade with their nearest neighbors:
  Lesmishan to the north, Husk and Falth to the west, and Hadla to the south.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Bridgemoor sits directly on Nalathesh’s eastern border, and traders from
  Bridgemoor do frequently traverse Nalathesh due to their easy access to the
  nation. Nalatheshi traders also travel through Bridgemoor to reach Kendaria.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Nalathesh’s military is well-trained and well-equipped. All
  soldiers respond directly to the Godking or his commanders. The elite
  Bronzeguard are a legion of cavaliers that ride dracani into combat,
  decimating threats to the kingdom. They often patrol the Flesh Pit to ensure
  that its foul presence does not spread.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While far from the largest standing military on Gathandia, Nalathesh invests a
  tremendous amount of money and magical research into making their military as
  strong as possible.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Worship of the Godking is mandatory. National taxes are seen
  as a religious responsibility, and any sign of insincerity in one’s worship of
  the Godking is punishable with imprisonment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Nalatheshi culture revolves around the Godking, international
  trade, and the harsh but fascinating truths of desert living. Shade and wind
  are often celebrated as gifts from the Godking’s mercy, and sudden rainstorms
  might cause merchants and laborers to stop their work for the day and engage
  in revelry.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>A vast criminal network lurks throughout the nation, thus
  far undiscovered by the Godking. Known as the Sandsnakes, this network
  smuggles information, spices, and fine goods to the powerful and corrupt
  bankers of Lesmishan.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ARIDALA</b></h3>
<p>
  A sprawling metropolis of multistory adobe apartments, vibrant bazaars, and
  confusing alleys, Aridala is the capital of Nalathesh. It rests on the only
  lake in the kingdom that doesn’t dry up each summer. The Godking’s palace is
  carved into the side of a sandstone cliff and is some of the most stunning
  architecture in Gathandia. The streets of Aridala are well maintained and
  crime is virtually nonexistent under the watchful eyes of the Radiant Princes.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>The Desert.</b> Most of Nalathesh is arid, scrubby desert. The terrain
  varies between pebbly sand in some areas, crumbling canyons in others, and
  rolling hills through the rest. Survival in this desert is easy for those who
  can identify edible plants and who know how to avoid venomous snakes and
  insects, but can be deadly for the uninformed. The crescent of land in
  Nalathesh’s south is much more fertile, sporting larger trees and greener
  grasses thanks to multitudinous freshwater springs.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Flesh Pit. </b>Near the center of Nalathesh’s expansive desert, there
  dwells a great pit of flesh. Miners have found that they can harvest this
  flesh and it makes fine jerky. Scientists use the flesh to conduct experiments
  with caustic reagents. Occasionally, the flesh awakens and eats some
  unfortunate folk, but the Bronzeguard stands ready for such events.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  At the heart of the Flesh Pit, a full-grown M’l’ykkri waits with its hungering
  maw.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Great Chasm. </b>About half of Nalathesh’s border overlooks the Great
  Chasm. See Bridgemoor’s Points of Interest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Floating Islands. </b>Soaring above the fresh springs and lush greenery in
  the south of the kingdom, a chain of limestone islands float like immortal
  guardians.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Legend has it that the Godking keeps them aloft through sheer force of will as
  a sign of his power, but many scholars quietly doubt that this is the case. No
  one has yet been able to reach the floating islands; some of the Bronzeguard
  have tried with their dracani, but to no avail.

  <b>NAUSA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A remarkable city-state off the southern coast of Gathandia, Nausa is almost
  entirely underwater. Constructed primarily by amphibious humanoids, notably
  merfolk and dwellvur, Nausa serves as a gateway between land-based
  civilizations and subaquatic ones.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Nausa"
  src="https://files.d20.io/images/475963767/oa0ysdbQOt3m4qtKa5gD5Q/original.png?1771160454"
  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Nausa is shaped from massive coral structures, plaster, and thick, watertight
  weaves of seaweed. It is also enhanced with Avadrium, a strange metallic alloy
  that has magical properties. Nausa has a small port with a series of piers
  that jut above the surface of the ocean. This port contains a deep shaft with
  Avadrium lifts running up and down its length, allowing air-breathing
  humanoids to descend into Nausa’s interior buildings.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The vast majority of Nausa’s buildings reside on the ocean floor, hundreds of
  feet below the surface. Swimming hatches allow divers to easily access the
  ocean floor and return directly into the city, rather than having to dive from
  the surface of the ocean every time they wish to explore. These swimming
  hatches use two doors to prevent the water from flooding into the city.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Nausa has a large university that attracts all kinds of
  scientists, especially biologists eager to study wondrous sea life.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>An elected triumvirate governs Nausa. Each
  triumvir has a six-year term, but elections to the triumvirate are staggered
  so that a new triumvir has a chance of getting elected once every two years.
  This offers some continuity as each new triumvir has a couple years to learn
  from those who already have experience in office, but it has led at times to
  chaotic decades of constant politicking.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Nausa exports very unique wares to merchant
  sailors, which brings a lucrative income to Nausa’s economy. Nausa exports
  shells, pearls, and coral skeletons as works of art or fine jewelry.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  They also export a tough, fibrous seaweed cloth that functions much like
  waterproof leather or hide armor. But Nausa’s most valuable export is its
  pigment dye taken from the saliva of sea slugs that dwell on the ocean floor.
  This dye produces a rich purple hue and is highly sought after by royalty and
  prominent politicians.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Nausa does not maintain a military, as they live underwater
  and are both geographically and economically protected from invasion by any
  land-dwelling nation. The city watch is competent at keeping the peace within
  the city and are all trained as deep-sea divers, capable of mounting rescue
  missions or fighting off sea creatures beyond the scope of the city when
  needed.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Most Nausans practice the old faith held by the merfolk and
  dwellvur from before the Tear. On multiple occasions in ancient history, an
  enormous kaijan reminiscent of a turtle or a dinosaur is believed to have
  saved aquatic civilizations from another kaijan that looked like a blend of a
  squid and a humanoid. The former, called Jiruk, represents strength, honor,
  and sacrificial protection. The latter, called Thul, embodies an all-consuming
  desire to corrupt and destroy. While neither have been sighted in hundreds of
  years, many Nausans worship Jiruk as their savior and their patron god.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Nausans are a mix of traditional and progress-driven folk.
  Traditionalists keep the practices of ancient aquatic nations alive and are
  more likely to be strongly religious. Progressives focus on trade with the
  land-based world and are very politically involved. They are generally not as
  concerned with matters of religion or the soul.

  <b>Underworld. </b>As is true of any nation that has valuable commodities,
  Nausa has its share of black market dealers that steal and resell pearls and
  their royal purple dye at criminal rates. Known as the Undertow, the largest
  syndicate has a well-organized mix of merchants and deep sea divers that keep
  a steady stream of dye flowing to the world’s black markets.

  <b>NENT</b>

<p>
  A humid coastal state, Nent is known for its rocky shores, rolling hills, and

  subsidiary state of the great empire.

  <b>Academic. </b>Nent has a single university in Amphos, but all of its

<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Nentese do not believe in aristocracy.
  Instead, they prefer to practice classical direct democracy: every citizen
  gets to vote on every single issue, and if a majority is not reached then
  status quo is maintained. As a relatively small nation, Nentese find it
  feasible to travel to a central gathering place once every year or two to vote
  on a wide variety of issues. Unfortunately for the Nentese, their democracy is
  no longer practiced now that they are a vassal state of Roshallan.

  <b>Militant. </b>Nent no longer has any military to speak of, instead relying

<br />
<p>
  <b>Social and Underworld. </b>Most Nentese are suspicious, both of foreigners
  and of one another. After Roshallan annexed their nation, Roshallan appointed
  some Nentese citizens to act as governors overseeing Nent’s various provinces.
  Most Nentese view this as a complete degradation of their democracy and resent
  their leaders for going along with Roshallan’s edicts. Many Nentese have taken
  it upon themselves to rebel against Roshallan and against those among the
  Nentese who were so morally bankrupt as to sell themselves into Roshallan’s
  pocket. This creates a vicious cycle, as the Roshallani insist on law-abiding
  Nentese suppressing their own people’s rebellion.

  <b>NEVNA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Nevna is primarily a coastal nation, as inland of its major cities there is
  nothing but rocky desert that has proven to yield little in the way of food or
  minerals. The temperate coasts yield some basic agriculture to supplement the
  Nevnan diet that is primarily fish and other seafood.
</p>
<br />
<img

  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Over the centuries, Nevnan seafarers became more daring and greedy, plundering
  other ships and bringing the loot back to the mainland. Nevna’s rulers at the
  time denounced such actions, and those rulers were promptly deposed. Nevna is
  now respected and feared as a formidable pirate nation ruled by the wealthiest
  and most feared among the pirates: Jaken the Bronze, a trollkin mighty in both
  physique and influence.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While Nevna will occasionally engage in fair maritime trade with the coastal
  nations, most Nevnans prefer piracy, and their only real ally is the
  city-state of Vel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Nevna places little value in scholasticism. A person’s
  capability aboard a ship or in the barren foothills should be all that you
  need to determine someone’s worth.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocracy. </b>Although once a monarchy, Nevna no longer places any stock
  in royal blood.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile. </b>Nevna exports fine goods of many varieties. Virtually all
  of the finished goods that they sell are plundered from other merchant ships,
  so aside from the inherent danger involved it is a massively profitable market
  as long as they can find people to buy their wares.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Most Nevnan sailors are also capable fighters. Nevna has a
  huge navy, but a very small standing guard force in each of its coastal towns.
  Because of the vast and harsh desert isolating them from the rest of the
  world, they do not feel the need to have a large land army.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Political. </b>Nobody in Nevna tries to maintain pretenses. Nevna is a
  criminal nation, run by criminals. Jaken the Bronze and other formidable
  pirate lords serve as the totalitarian rulers of their favorite port cities,
  and when a matter of national significance rises, these pirate lords will
  parley to discuss what needs done.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>There are a handful of temples to sea gods throughout Nevna,
  but heartfelt worship is uncommon. Most Nevnan sailors respect the sea, but do
  not deify it, and think that the most valuable asset they have is not faith,
  but their own two hands.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Nevna can be a rough place to live. Few people spare a second
  glance for the man getting mugged in the alley. In a cutthroat culture, one
  needs only look after themself.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ASHORI</b></h3>
<p>
  Ashori, the capital of Nevna, is Jaken the Bronze’s personal lair. A
  ramshackle city built of limestone, mud huts, and driftwood shanties, Ashori
  doesn’t look like much. Even so, its markets have many fine goods from
  throughout Gathandia’s east coast. Skilled labor and exquisite crafts exist in
  abundance, but con artists and opportunists will prey on any who look foolish
  enough to fall for their wiles.

  nation with craggy ravines and dark pine forests, the folk of Noord are often

  <b>Academic. </b>Noord maintains a handful of small schools for education in
  various fields. Young people are not allowed to attend schools and asked to
  serve their people through physical labor of some kind. Older folk who are no
  longer capable of intense physical labor are encouraged to attend school and
  commit their minds to the betterment of their nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Noord does not have a traditional
  aristocracy, but the older humanoids who have attended schooling are treated
  with respect and deference. They receive free food and lodging when they
  travel within Noord, and those who complete their schooling are looked to as
  community leaders. Regional governors and a national chancellor are
  self-selected from within this pool of educated elders. Noord’s current
  chancellor is Grumhilda Iceblack, a stern and grandmotherly mountain dwarf.
  Grumhilda is close friends with the Starborea’s governor, Dencassan Briarye.
  Thanks to their friendship, Noord and Doshairiel have become close trade
  partners.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Noord is well-situated with both a large forest
  and a mountain range that each contain many natural resources. Gathering food,
  game, and lumber from the forest, and minerals and iron ore from the
  mountains, Noord could be self-sufficient if it needed to be. Trading with and
  raiding other nations is a supplemental source of goods and income.

<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Every young adult is required to serve in the military and
  their training begins before they are ten years old. At sixteen, they join the
  ranks, and after four years’ service they may remain in the military or pursue
  an apprenticeship and career elsewhere in Noord society.
</p>

<p>
  The Noord military is highly competent, large proportional to its population,
  and well-equipped. The military will engage in months-long thieving
  expeditions where they march into the steppes of Bishal and Kandiff, looting
  and pillaging whenever they find small trade caravans or stray ranchers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Noord has no official religion. So long as a Noord puts the
  needs of their country above their own personal needs, they may practice
  whatever religious beliefs they wish. Many worship winter as a cruel but
  necessary deity that hardens and strengthens them through adversity, and they
  worship the northern lights as an omen of luck and fortune.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Noords are a proud folk, and easily angered. They take pride in
  both their personal valor and the strength of their nation. A careless insult
  is punishable with a magnitude of broken bones, and while duels to resolve
  conflict are strictly forbidden in the military, they often happen both within
  and outside the confines of the military order.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Each of Noord’s towns and cities have gangs that scrap over
  territory, but they are frequently snuffed out by the military only to form
  again after a few months of silence. There is no nation-wide organized
  structure to these gangs.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>PHALANX</b></h3>
<p>
  The mountainous capital of Noord, Phalanx resides in the northernmost
  stretches of the nation. Built on the icy cliffs on the northern end of the
  mainland Cloudpiercer Range, Noords believe Phalanx to be utterly impregnable.
  The elders of Noord have invested much time and energy in expanding Phalanx to
  the point that the capital now stretches across four mountain peaks, but is
  only accessible through one. In the unthinkable event of Noord’s military
  suffering a crippling defeat, the entire population of Noord could fit inside
  Phalanx. It has two freshwater springs underneath it, not to mention the vast
  quantity of snow and ice, so Noords would only need to worry about their food
  supply in the event of a prolonged siege. The harsh winters would then force
  any rational foe to retreat.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While it is built to survive warfare, Phalanx also offers amenities such as a
  sports arena and an orchestra hall.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>The Glowing Forest. </b>On the west side of the Cloudpiercer Range, strange
  trees grow in oddly regular patterns. These trees seem to be made of some
  synthesis of vegetable and metal matter, and they grow pear-shaped glass bulbs
  that occasionally glow from within. Noords are generally hesitant to enter the
  forest, but will occasionally go out and collect these glass lights, which
  they use to illuminate Phalanx.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Noords ask the heroes to harvest resources from the Glowing Forest.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the face of invasion from a terribly powerful enemy (perhaps fiends from
    Inferno), heroes need to help the Noords evacuate to Phalanx and then must
    endure a harsh winter fighting a supernaturally strong foe.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Noords are on a rampaging war path, so representatives from Kandiff ask
    the heroes to infiltrate Phalanx and destabilize its defenses or assassinate
    its leaders.

  <b>PASH</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Located at the mouth of a great bay that opens up into the ocean, Pash is an
  economically and militarily powerful city-state that facilitates major
  international trade. The Pashan International Bank is the largest bank in
  Gathandia and contains a vast sum of riches. When Pash is threatened by a
  foreign power, the autocrats weigh the costs of fighting the invading force or
  simply bribing them to move on. This calculation, when also weighed by the
  aggressor, usually mitigates bloodshed.

  <b>Academic. </b>Pash has a large internationally acclaimed university that
  offers virtually any course imaginable but specializes in economic theory.
  Pashan merchants that retire for a quieter end of life will often teach these
  courses. The Pashan Academy attracts scholars from many nations.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic, Political, and Militant. </b>Pash is ruled by an autocracy.
  Military generals are also legislators and magisters, overseeing every aspect
  of Pashan life. Both the Pashan army and navy are well-equipped, well-staffed,
  and well-trained. The military keeps everything in Pash carefully controlled.
  Their borders with Vaenyth and Roshallan are both heavily guarded and
  fortified.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Under the direction of the generals, the merchant
  lords and bankers of Pash play Vaenyth and Roshallan off of one another in
  order to keep either belligerent nation from conquering Pash. As Pash is built
  on both banks of the massive Great Bay, they thrive on running merchant
  ferries across the bay and docking international trade ships the world over.
  The river that feeds into the Great Bay is also quite rich in gold, so Pashan
  divers mine the gold from the riverbed to feed their economy. Pash has
  powerful and reliable banks that many wealthy merchants and royalty from
  dozens of nations will use to keep their assets safe.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Most Pashans fervently worship the Celestial Council and the
  Avatars, believing that their devout faith is part of what affords them
  ongoing safety from both Vaenyth and Roshallan.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Pashans are not unkind, but they are generally quite cunning.
  Pashan merchants are ruthless hagglers, and the divers and miners are
  typically rugged and competent fighters.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  As hard-edged as Pashans usually are, they are also hospitable, believing that
  treating visitors well will reflect positively and draw more international
  business.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>A huge crime syndicate thrives in Pash’s grimy underworld.
  It has its hands in every aspect of Pashan life, from mining to banking to
  ferrying merchants across the Great Bay. The crime lords also act as points of
  contact for other international syndicates, especially the mob bosses of
  Falth.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Floating Islands. </b>Large chunks of floating rock hover above much of the
  Great Bay and the river that feeds it. These structures extend up the Vaenyth
  Range. Pashan bankers have paid mages to fly to the rocks and determine if
  there is anything valuable to be gained from them. The assessment was
  conclusive: the floating islands are rich in Arcanium and Primor, two rare and
  valuable minerals with unique magical properties. Pash is currently in the
  process of determining how best to mine these resources.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Great Bay. </b>The Great Bay is so wide that it takes just over a day
  to sail from one side to the other. The Vaenyth River feeds into the Great

  built on both of the Great Bay’s banks and on the islands that dot the region.

  <b>RENDEN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Renden is a nation of seafarers that brutally raid coastal towns and cities
  along the Inner Sea. Originally, the people of Renden shared much of their
  culture with Fjordenhavian, Noord, and Teivosi society, but over the
  generations, the people of Renden lost all shred of morality.
</p>
<br />
<img

  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Known as the terrors of the Inner Sea, the Renden do not discriminate between
  any town or seafaring vessel of any nation. They will raid anything, leaving
  boats and buildings in burning ruins and leaving sailors and townsfolk to rend
  their clothes and beg for mercy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Renden is administered by the Circle of
  Matriarchs. These are elder Renden women with a deep connection to the Primal
  Source. Capable of calming great sea storms, they rule from their enormous
  vessel, the <em>Ravager</em>, which often has several smaller boats and wide,
  flat barges lashed to it or anchored nearby.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While the Circle of Matriarchs make legislative decisions for their nation,
  the Kings of the Sea enforce these laws and conduct raids. Each captain of a
  coastal longship or a deep-sea pirate ship is considered a King of the Sea.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Renden do not trade with other nations, for they
  never willingly give anything to those who are not their own. Rather, they
  plunder and pillage whenever they need to supplement their internal economy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>The Renden are competent sailors and vicious coastal
  fighters. Their longships are narrow, quiet, fast, and low to the ground. This
  allows them to quickly come upon a coastal town and catch any watchguards by
  surprise. Renden deep sea vessels, like the <em>Ravager</em>, are much larger
  and slower.

</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE RAVAGER</b></h3>
<p>
  The <em>Ravager</em> is a twelve-masted boat of tremendous size. Covered in
  living vegetation grown by the magical hands of the Circle of Matriarchs, it
  could be mistaken at a distance for a small island. The
  <em>Ravager </em>contains an entire marketplace, two inns and taverns, and a
  council chamber where the Circle of Matriarchs make decisions for their
  nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Several large Renden barges often float nearby, housing stolen goods and
  additional taverns and marketplaces aboard their wooden decks.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE ISLANDS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Renden are more at home on sea than land, but they have many hidden coves
  and obscure islands in the Inner Sea where they stash their wares or
  occasionally go for leisurely hunting expeditions.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>NACHTSTROND</b></h3>
<p>
  The Renden will, at all costs and on pain of death, avoid Nachtstrond, or the
  Black Coast. This stretch of woodland appears to be in a constant state of
  blighted decay, and an enormous but withered World-Tree stretches its thorny
  boughs over the expanse of craggy forbidden shores. The Renden believe that
  the area is haunted by the souls of all humanoids killed violently. Needless
  to say, if this is true, then any Renden that sets foot on the shore will be
  torn apart by vengeful ghosts in a matter of moments.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>

  <b>ROSHALLAN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A tremendous empire sprawling from Gathandia’s west coast to the Cloudpiercer
  Range, as far north as Chee and as far south as Nent, Roshallan is widely
  considered the most powerful nation on the continent and is unquestionably the
  largest. Roshallan’s natural environment changes dramatically given how large
  it is. It encompasses swathes of desert, two small mountain ranges, enormous
  stretches of plains, and dense forests. Roshallan is also the undisputed naval
  power in the lower Inner Sea. Roshallan’s navy has yet to be tested against
  the Renden of the upper Inner Sea.

<p>
  Thus far, Roshallan has conquered Chee, Nent, Getar, and most of Thaaj,

<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Roshallan has built some spectacular universities, primarily
  in its stretch of grassland along the southern coast of the Inner Sea.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  These universities are some of the best-designed in Gathandia and attract
  Anedonian scholars and other prestigious thinkers despite Roshallan’s negative
  international reputation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Roshallan’s emperor oversees the entire
  empire from the capital. The emperor delegates individual sectors of
  governance, such as finance or security, to their council, who work with
  regional monarchs to ensure that Roshallan’s interests are maintained. These
  rulers often employ a feudal system within their territory but are given the
  authority to structure the government of their own region however they deem
  best. Monarchs that show any signs of insubordination against the emperor are
  quickly taken care of. Roshallan’s first mighty emperor who began Roshallan’s
  era of conquest was Exandros. Its current emperor, Nerian, is still very
  competent if not yet as legendary as his predecessor. Emperor Nerian has every
  intention to decisively conquer Chehozran within the next five years.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Given its massive sprawl, Roshallan is a
  tremendous economic powerhouse. It facilitates trade within its vast empire by
  developing sturdy, durable roads that cut down on travel time. It also trades
  with Pash, Ahten, and Anedonia, each of whom have proven strong enough to
  resist Roshallan’s aggressions. Many international merchant vessels dock along
  Roshallan’s southwest coast.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Roshallan boasts a large and disciplined military. It has a
  naval presence in the Inner Sea thanks to the shipyards of Chee. On land,
  Roshallan’s military is divided into legions - groups of one thousand soldiers
  led by generals. Each general oversees a commander, who leads one hundred of
  the legion’s troops. Roshallan benefits from well-crafted weaponry and
  advanced tactical training.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The Roshallani worship the Celestial Council, believing that
  the Council has blessed them with prosperity due to their own righteousness.
  Roshallani believe that so long as they continue their divine mandate to unite
  Gathandia, fortune will continue to smile upon them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Roshallani citizens are fiercely proud of their nation. They
  are not very hospitable to foreign travelers, and are equally unfriendly
  towards the peoples of Roshallani vassal states. Annexed folk, such as
  Nentese, generally despise the Roshallani.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Crime lords lurk in most large Roshallani cities,
  conducting their own business out of the sight of their ruling monarchs.
  Brigands and bandit gangs also make the countryside their hunting ground,
  preying on merchants and travelers.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TIBERIA</b></h3>
<p>
  A shining city of grand proportions, Tiberia’s architecture reflects
  Roshallan’s splendor. It is built between the foothills of the Marble
  Mountains and Lake Tiberia. Many of its finest buildings are constructed of
  white marble mined from the mountains that sparkles gloriously in the sun.
  Tiberia offers much entertainment for its citizenry, and the Grand Coliseum
  draws crowds from all across the empire to watch magnificent battles.
  Tiberia’s temples are frequented by those who wish to make offerings to the
  Celestial Council, and the bathhouses are also a popular haunt of well-off
  citizens of the region. The emperor’s palace is nearly as large as the Grand
  Coliseum with scores of luxurious rooms for the emperor and their guests to
  enjoy.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Lava Fields. </b>Roshallan’s eastern region is split by large lava fields
  that flow from the mountains down to the sea. While the land in the immediate
  vicinity is a charred ruin, the land just beyond is quite fertile and
  Roshallani farmers sow it to produce great quantities of food each year.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Marble Mountains. </b>A rocky, craggy mountain range rife with volcanic
  activity marks the border between Roshallan and Ahten. These mountains are
  full of marble, which the Roshallani mine as a great economic resource for
  themselves and for international trade.

  <b>ROVEL</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The most prolific seafaring traders in Gathandia live in Rovel. A large
  forested peninsula west of Falth and prominent in the Inner Sea, Rovel enjoys
  warm summers and chilly winters but virtually no major swings to unbearably
  hot or cold. Seasonal thunderstorms occasionally bring tornadoes with them,
  though this is not a common occurrence.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Rovel’s docks - especially the docks of Hollyport - are the largest in
  Gathandia, capable of housing massive fleets of military or merchant vessels.
  Although they share the Inner Sea with the bloodthirsty Renden, they have
  proven both militarily strong enough to withstand raids and economically
  cunning enough to buy out the Renden.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Rovel places a good deal of emphasis on a robust education.
  Merchants that trade internationally bring in most of Rovel’s economic
  success, and students that learn the cultures of other nations, learn the
  technical aspects of trade and commerce, and understand the physics of sailing
  are - in Rovelese belief - the most likely to flourish. Children are expected
  to receive a basic education and encouraged to take specialized classes in
  sailing, cultural communications, international commerce, or banking.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Rovel has a monarchy, but at any given
  point a king or queen is really no more than a figurehead. The real political
  and legislative power in the nation is in the hands of the merchant guilds,
  and they use the monarch to give legitimacy to any laws that they want
  enacted.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>The powerful merchant families in Rovel really
  run the nation. If they were to remove their support from the monarch, then
  the monarch’s entire reign would economically fall apart. With their massive,
  well-armed trade caravels, Rovel’s merchant fleet trade far and wide,
  extending as far as Yodvan to the northeast and Pash to the southwest. Many
  merchant vessels keep small chests of gold on board as insurance against
  Renden raids. Renden raiders know that the Rovelese can put up quite a fight
  on the water, so they will often accept small tolls in exchange for letting
  the Rovelese sail through their waters otherwise unmolested.

<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Rovelese are more enamored of their economic success than
  displays of piety. Temples are not very common in Rovelese towns or cities,
  and the religious among the nation usually practice their religion in the
  privacy of their own homes with small gatherings of likeminded friends and
  family.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Most Rovelese folk are very results-driven and enjoy bragging
  about their successes. They are willing enough to lend a hand to someone in

  demonstrating that they are good, upstanding folk.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Falthic spies run rampant in Rovelese society. Some such
  spies - and even some unscrupulous Rovelese - will sell merchant ship sailing
  routes to Renden, allowing the violent raiders to ambush boats.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>HOLLYPORT</b></h3>
<p>
  Rovel’s capital city is perhaps unsurprisingly its largest port. The monarchy
  has a decadent but not very defensible palace, and the most powerful merchant
  lords have incredibly well defended manors that are almost as plush and
  luxurious as the monarch’s palace. Hollyport has an enormous network of docks
  and piers that allow their large merchant vessels to maintain year-round trade
  with the nations in and beyond the Inner Sea.

  <b>RUPTAEA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A nation clinging to chilly rocks and sparse boreal forests, Ruptaea’s harsh
  land has solicited a generous response from its people. The rainy summers and
  blizzard-ridden winters have instilled in Ruptaeans a sense of kinship and
  shared suffering. Ruptaeans will commonly invite one another over to share in
  what little food they have.

  <b>Academic. </b>Most of Ruptaea’s settlements have schools that cover the
  basics of reading, mathematics, and history. Ruptaea has no major universities
  or advanced educational institutions, which is something that Queen Belle is
  trying to remedy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>The aristocracy of Ruptaea are the lords
  and ladies that govern each individual settlement. These aristocrats elect a
  monarch from among their ranks; that monarch rules until their death or
  abdication, at which point the aristocrats elect the monarch’s successor. The
  current monarch is a hondu named Belle, better known for her empathetic nature
  than for her political smarts.

  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Ruptaea is economically weak with few natural
  resources to offer in international trade. It has some mineral mines, some
  stone quarries, and some forests that can produce timber and plant and animal
  byproducts, but none of its resources are notable enough to make Ruptaea
  competitive with other nations.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Ruptaea has a weak military, but they have a good
  relationship with Fjordenhaven and Eryndor. They dedicate most of their
  military resources to the border they share with Vaenyth.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>In general, Ruptaeans are very religious. They worship many
  pantheons, making sacrificial offerings to the Celestial Council for good
  luck, to the Fiends and Exiles of Inferno to ward off their wrath, and to the
  Archfae Conclaves for bounty. They also worship the Avadri and Avatars,
  primarily because they do not want any pantheon to feel overlooked or
  slighted.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Ruptaeans are humble folk, and this usually extends to the
  aristocracy as well. They will make plans for their days or weeks, but if a
  neighbor or traveler needs food or shelter, most Ruptaeans will invite them
  into their own homes and provide for those who need it, setting aside their
  own plans for the day.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Small, localized gangs are uncommon but not unheard of in
  some of the larger towns and cities. Given Ruptaea’s poor economy, large crime
  syndicates have not formed in the nation as there is no major profit to be
  gained.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ESSUR</b></h3>
<p>
  The capital of Ruptaea is Essur. Built on a hill rich with groundwater
  springs, it is one of the most defensible locations in the nation. A small
  palace of common stone polished to resemble marble is the residence of the
  reigning monarch. Marketplaces and cramped residential houses spread out in a
  tangle of crooked streets radiating from the palace. Many temples stand proud
  throughout the city as well, and the foundation has been laid for the new
  Essur University.

  Ruptaeans harvest ice from the glacier, and young adventurous types try to
  climb it and explore its frigid top.

  <b>The Storm. </b>A couple days’ sail from Ruptaea’s west coast, a tremendous
  hurricane churns in perpetuity. It has been there for hundreds of years, never
  moving, never growing or shrinking either in size or in magnitude. Known
  simply as the Storm, the Ruptaeans do not know why it has sustained itself
  without moving, but so long as it continues to remain static it poses no
  threat to the nation.

  <b>SHADRADOTH</b>
</h2>
<p>
  In the subtropical hills of Thunderhead Vale, Shadradoth has a storied and
  chaotic history. It seceded from Valstrom long ago after a bloody civil war.
  The king regent, who was an advisor to the recently deceased king, refused to
  abdicate when the king’s eldest daughter came of age and made her claim to the
  throne. The ensuing war split the nation apart, with Princess Shadra leading
  the region that eventually became Shadradoth.

  style="width: 390px; float: right"

<p>
  Shadradoth upheld the heirship of Queen Shadra for several generations
  thereafter. However, the kingdom crumbled again when Shadra’s descendent, King
  Thunharad, did not sire an heir or pronounce any of his cousins next in line.
  Anyone who could claim relations to King Thunharad claimed that they were the
  heir apparent. The ensuing war devastated the country, and to this day
  Shadradoth still has not recovered.

<p>
  <b>Academic.</b> Shadradoth has many schools in its larger towns, most of
  which were established when Shadradoth was still part of Valstrom. However,
  few of these institutions are still staffed in any meaningful way.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>The Shadradothan governmental system is a
  complete disaster. Half of the nation runs itself like a feudal system, but
  there is no central uniting authority. Many merchants and some whole towns or
  small regions instead govern themselves through democratic elections and
  consensus votes. The result is a mishmash of half-baked political theories
  that do not work on their own, let alone when interacting with one another.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Individual settlements often trade with one
  another within Shadradoth. Those on the border near another nation will also
  trade with their neighbors, but any form of organized international trade is
  nonexistent due to Shadradoth’s dysfunctional government.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>While the political process by which settlements run
  themselves vary widely among Shadradothan towns, each town has a militia that
  can be rallied by whatever political force leads that town.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  In this respect, the Shadradothan military is very feudal in its structure,
  lacking any nationalized model.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Some Shadradothans share religious beliefs with the
  Valstromians. They worship the Celestial Council and believe that the good or
  evil actions of an individual will be blessed or punished by the Council.
  Other Shadradothans believe that the Exiles should be venerated and see their
  own nation as exiled in a sense, as Shadra should have been the rightful queen
  of Valstrom.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Shadradoth’s population is angry and distrusting. They cannot
  agree with one another on politics, religion, or basic cultural practices.
  This is less pronounced within individual settlements, where folk may overlook
  perceived slights in their neighbors’ behavior. On a national scale, however,
  many towns and regions despise one another.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Given the chaos inherent in Shadradoth’s culture and
  politics, crime syndicates flourish. Notable syndicates include the Twice
  Strikes, the Hoods, and the Galepiercers. These syndicates operate widely in
  both Shadradoth and Valstrom.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Twice Strikes get their name from their earned reputation of robbing a
  place twice: first nonviolently burgling it and getting a lay of the land, and
  second by brutally attacking any who try to defend the place. The Hoods are
  beloved by the peasantry as they rob from the rich and give their richest to
  the poor. Finally, the Galepiercers are so named for the elementals that they
  summon to cause chaos, which they use to draw attention from their illicit
  activity.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THUNHARAN</b></h3>
<p>
  Formerly the capital city of Shadradoth, Thunharan is now a smoking ruin.
  After the tremendous civil war that ravaged Shadradoth, there is no central
  authority around which all regions can unite.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Cloudpiercers. </b>The Cloudpiercer Range’s tallest mountains overshadow
  Shadradoth. One of the mountains is so enormous that nobody has ever seen its
  peak. It always disappears above the clouds, or is so tall that the slight
  haze of the atmosphere obscures its magnificent heights. Although foolish
  adventurers have tried to climb it, none have even come remotely close to
  seeing its peak.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Thundervale River. </b>In the bend of the Thundervale River, the
  Shadradothans have discovered a wondrous point of power. The river strikes a
  cliff and flows <em>up </em>the face of it like an upside-down waterfall. It
  then continues on its flow southward towards Sozein.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  As Valstrom’s sovereign territory begins on the other half of the river,
  Shadradoth and Valstrom have agreed to construct a neutral city at the base of
  the waterfall so that they can experience its wonder together. Explorers have
  found that the waterfall also contains a portal to the Everwilds.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Boiling discontent washes through Shadharoth as multiple nobles and
    democratically elected officials each claim that they should oversee the
    entire nation. The heroes might get involved to make a power play themselves
    or to back a contender whose views they find commendable.
  </li>
  <li>
    A noble who claims to be the direct descendent of Shadra asks the heroes to
    guard them as they travel to the Great Cloudpierce, the tallest mountain in
    the world, where they believe they can procure evidence verifying their
    claim.
  </li>
  <li>
    Valstrom has conquered the city that they have historically shared with
    Shadradoth at the base of the waterfall. Nobles and diplomats ask the heroes

    occupy the city.

  <b>SKAVR</b>
</h2>
<p>
  It is said that the Skavri are born with axes in hand and sent to battle fell
  beasts by their second birthday. A cold, hard nation of cold, hard people,
  Skavr sprawls across the northwest forests of the Inner Sea.
</p>

  style="width: 390px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  The Skavri stretch of forest is old and steeped in ancient legend. The boreal
  trees themselves seem to whisper of the many monsters, battles, and feats of
  heroism that they have witnessed over the generations. Skavr has chilly
  summers and icy winters. As brutal winds from the Ice Sea roll down on Skavr,
  snow smothers the nation and the Northern Lights seem to taunt the frigid
  settlements.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Skavri are skilled woodcarvers and carpenters. Their buildings have steep,
  wood-shingled roofs that drain the heavy snowfall down to the ground, but
  their buildings are as decorative as they are functional. Relief scenes are
  carved in the outsides of many log cabins and merchant stores, and these
  scenes generally depict tales of Skavri heroism in the face of any number of
  horrid monsters or the dreaded Renden raids.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>The capital of Skavr possesses a large library run by a
  handful of dedicated scholars, but beyond this there are no formal institutes
  of education in the nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Military. </b>Skavr is a nation of warrior-kings. Each
  town is governed by the strongest warrior, who tends to legislative and
  judicial responsibilities during times of peace and who leads their warriors
  from the front lines during times of war.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  At any point during times of peace, another warrior may challenge their town’s
  warrior-king for the throne. The challenger and the incumbent battle with
  blunted weapons until one yields. When incumbents feel that they are too old
  to continue leading battles from the front lines, they may abdicate to a
  challenge whom they believe is a worthy heir.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  All warrior-kings defer to the High King. The High King can also be challenged
  by warrior-kings, but not by any Skavri citizen who is not a warrior-king.
  Skavr’s current High King, named Muris Irontusk, is an enormous trollkin who
  has no decorum or manners but is nonetheless an intuitively successful leader.

<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The Skavri are not particularly religious, but those who do

<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Skavri are generally hostile to foreigners and prefer to keep
  to themselves. The exception is folk from Eryndor, whom the Skavri see as
  siblings in the fight against the horrors of the forest. The Skavri also
  tolerate Fjordenhavians, but they privately believe these folk to be too soft
  for the harshness of the far north.

    an artifact they plundered from a merchant vessel.

  <li>

  <b>SOZEIN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Sozein populates the western stretch of the Kozia Rainforest. Like Tafunga,
  Sozein has tremendous trees that divide the rainforest into three separate
  habitats: the emergent layer high above the rest of the forest, the canopy
  where most natural life dwells, and the forest floor, reserved primarily for
  rodents and some reptiles such as snakes and crocodiles. The Sozeini swathe of
  the Kozia Rainforest also has dense bamboo forests, which are smaller than the
  rainforest at large but are impossibly dense to navigate.

  institutions. Magic and its practical applications is a chief area of study
  among Sozeini scholars.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Sozein operates on a governmental system
  similar to a feudal system, but with only a dynastic emperor and the local
  governors of settlements. There are no lords or ladies that act as middle
  management between individual towns and the dynastic authorities, though there
  are emissaries from the emperor trained to speak on behalf of the royal
  family. The same dynastic family, the Long’han dynasty, has been in charge of
  Sozein for over a thousand years.

</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Sozein has a cutting-edge military with fighters that

<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The Sozeini worship five of the six Archfae Conclaves in

</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Sozein offers little social safety for those who are unable to

  interested in it from an academic standpoint. Magical scholars study the tree
  in hopes of learning how it grew so tall and what magical properties might be
  gleaned from it.
</p>
<br />

  <b>TAFUNGA</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Deep in the heart of the Kozia Rainforest, Tafunga is one of the most
  biodiverse regions in all Gathandia. The enormous rainforest can roughly be
  divided into three tiers. The emergent layer is composed of the tops of the
  highest trees, where raptors and other flying creatures roost. Beneath the
  emergent layer, the thick canopy is home to the majority of Tafungan life.
  Jaguars, monkeys, various birds and reptiles, and all manner of mythical
  creature make their homes in the thick, tangled overgrowth that ranges from a
  couple dozen to a couple hundred feet above the ground. Finally, the forest
  floor exists as a dark, shadowed realm that never sees the full light of day
  due to the thick canopy. Enormous rodents, snakes, and crocodiles lurk in this
  murky region.

<p>
  The tribes of Tafunga primarily make their homes in the wide boughs of the
  canopy, though some tribes or criminal groups are denizens of the forest
  floor. Tribes that live in the canopy are generally stationary, and those on
  the forest floor are usually forced to be nomadic due to monsoon weather
  causing seasonal flooding.

<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Tafunga does not have schools confined to libraries and
  lecture halls. Instead, wise town and village elders will hold practical
  lessons with their students in the real world, showing them how to harvest
  mushrooms, interact safely with wild animals, navigate the trees, and the
  like.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Tafungan society revolves around tribal
  communities. These tribes generally cooperate with one another, and tribal
  leaders will typically defer to whichever leader in a negotiation has the most
  populous tribe. Tribes will often team up with one another to fight monsters
  or foreign nations that pose a threat to all involved. If someone feels that
  their leader is insufficient to the task, then they can challenge the leader
  to a psionic duel imposed by mushroom consumption.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Tafunga is most internationally notable for its
  exportation of many types of mushrooms with culinary, medicinal, and
  recreational properties. Tafungan merchants generally do not trade with Sozein
  due to their ongoing conflicts, but they will readily sell their mushrooms to
  Hadla, Nausa, Valstrom, and Shadradoth, as well as to any international
  merchants who make the journey to Tafunga. However, upstanding Tafungans do
  not sell the starcap mushroom to any foreigners, as this mushroom is
  considered sacred and commodifying it in any form of trade arrangement would
  be seen as blasphemous.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>While all of Tafunga’s tribes together do not have a
  particularly large military, they do have a key advantage in tactical combat.
  Tafungan soldiers consume mushroom spores that allow them to communicate
  telepathically with other soldiers, which allows them to silently coordinate
  their attacks. This makes them especially effective at sabotage, infiltration,
  and similar high-skill missions.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Shamans in Tafungan society use starcap mushrooms to induce
  astral projection and vivid hallucinations. These shamans will then receive
  divine counsel from the gods. In these trips, the gods that the shamans speak
  with are usually the Archfae, although sometimes they are imaginary.

  <b>Social. </b>Tafungan peoples are generally very empathetic towards one
  another. An injured person from one tribe would be welcomed into the care of
  another tribe’s medical personnel without question.
</p>
<br />

  <b>Underworld. </b>Small, independent smuggling rings will export various
  mushrooms to the international black market. The most unscrupulous among them
  will even go so far as to sell starcap mushrooms.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LOOTSDAOT</b></h3>
<p>
  Tafunga’s largest tribe is Lootsdaot, which has a tremendous city in the
  canopy of the rainforest an hour’s walk north of the Kosia Sinkhole. Like
  other Tafungan tribes, Lootsdaot does not have any major buildings for
  administration, religion, or education, all of which occur in the natural
  world and among the citizenry. Lootsdaot does maintain large bathhouses on the
  forest floor, as well as performance theatres and large inns and taverns in
  the canopy.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Kozia Sinkhole. </b>In the heart of Tafunga, less than an hour’s journey
  from the outskirts of Lootsdaot, the Kozia Sinkhole drops some two hundred
  feet down into the ground. It experiences flooding during monsoon season, but
  the Tafungans have dug artificial cave networks in and around the sinkhole to
  mitigate as much flooding as possible. The Kozia Sinkhole contains a jungle of
  exclusively mushrooms and similar fungi. Massive mushrooms grow out of even
  larger mushrooms beneath them, and smaller mushrooms grow on and around the
  enormous ones. The Kozia Sinkhole is mined for its mushrooms the way another
  nation might mine gold.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The World-Tree. </b>Tafunga and Sozein have a tense peace at the World-Tree
  which rests on the border between the two nations. The Tafungans view this as
  a sacred site, and the Sozeini as an academic one. See Sozein for more
  information.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>Teivos</b></h2>
<p>
  Several large clans, comprised of tribes that each have several dozen family
  units, maintain a nomadic lifestyle, roaming across thousands of miles in the
  northern tundra, the Ice Sea, and parts of the Inner Sea. The clans usually
  follow herds of game animals such as bison, caribou, or even dolphins and
  seals. These clans, collectively known as the Teivos, have differing
  temperaments and differing relationships with other nations, but they all
  share basically the same culture with the other clans.
</p>
<br />

  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  <b>Mercantile. </b>Each Teivos clan is self-sufficient. By hunting game or
  taking from vegetation, they supply their own food, make their own clothes,
  and fashion any tools, boats, carriages, and the like that they might need.
  Many enjoy some form of crafting as a hobby, like whittling or jeweling. These
  craftspeople will occasionally trade with merchants of other nations when they
  are near a settled area.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Political.</b> Each clan maintains itself differently. Some prefer to hold
  democratic gatherings where each tribe collectively decides what the best
  course of action is and representatives from the tribes negotiate the clan’s
  actions based on this input. Others are almost feudal with a clan chieftain
  who delegates some responsibilities to tribal leaders. While each clan is
  self-governing, all clans defer to the High Queen, the leader of the Imurtok
  clan.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The clans share a belief in the sacredness of all plant and
  animal life, along with the changing of the seasons. The clans worship
  different Archfae conclaves accordingly, and most tribes have specific gods
  that they feel most connected with. Above all, though, the clans worship the
  mysterious and elusive Avadri, whom the clans believe created the cosmos and
  all within it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social.</b> Most clans are reclusive and avoid contact with permanent
  settlements, aside from occasionally trading with their merchants. The folk of
  each tribe generally welcome other nomads to their campfires and share what
  food they have with any who need it.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CLANS</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>Atpar. </b>The smallest of the six major clans, the Atpar are skillful
  sailors. They are mighty oceanic hunters, capable of taking down a killer
  whale while only sailing in large canoes. Needless to say, they feel more
  comfortable at sea than any other clan. Their patron deity is Porov.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Deniput. </b>The hunters of Deniput are the most skilled foresters among
  all the clans. They spend most of the year north of the Inner Sea and try to
  undertake their northern pilgrimage during the height of summer, hoping to
  mitigate the dangers on the Ice Sea. Their patron deity is Wolven.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Imurtok.</b> Imurtok is believed to be the oldest clan. All other clans, if
  they trace their lineage back far enough, came from Imurtok at some point. The
  Imurtok clan is also viewed as the leader of all Teivos clans, ruled by a High
  Queen that oversees the other clan leaders. Their patron deity is Vele.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Kanonar.</b> Kanonar has a reputation of being the most aggressive clan.
  Kanonar’s young warriors often go out of their way to find and fight monsters,
  and Kanonar has been known to get into conflicts with other nations. Their
  patron deity is Sekh.

  that they only complete their pilgrimage once every two years. Seen as wise
  and deliberative, the Nannuret have the most complicated governmental system.
  Their patron deity is Woden.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Tipiara. </b>Viewed by the other tribes as the most in touch with the
  spiritual world, Tipiara has many mystics and oracles among its ranks and
  often travel in patterns that make little sense to the other clans. Their
  patron deity is Stoll.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>PILGRIMAGE</b></h3>
<p>
  Each clan will make a pilgrimage to the holiest site of the Teivos at least
  once per year unless tremendous circumstances impede them. This holy site is
  an ancient ruin of a city completely filled with technology far beyond
  anything the Teivos have ever seen, in their own culture or anyone else’s. The
  city is nestled in the middle of concentric mountain peaks at the magnetic
  north pole of Ancerra and descends miles into the earth. The forgotten city -
  Vadreheim, they call it - somehow wards off the worst elements of winter and
  miraculously always has enough food and water for Teivos pilgrims.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Teivos believe that this ancient technological marvel is all that
  physically remains of the Avadri on the whole planet, and so they treat the
  site with great reverence and guard its location with fierce secrecy. Often,
  Teivos pilgrims will take small pieces of technology with them from the great
  site, gradually learning how to use the technology before returning the next
  year. It is a sacred custom to return one’s souvenir before taking a new one,
  so any Teivos tribesperson is likely to only have one piece of Avadri
  technology on them at any given time.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Something is wrong at Vadreheim. Two Teivos clans have gone missing, and
    only one Teivos sailor escaped. They implore the heroes to journey to
    Vadreheim and set things right.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Teivos and a non-nomadic nation each claim that the other attacked them.
    The heroes, being in the region, must negotiate a peace before both sides
    escalate.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Teivos have found that a horrible monster has taken up residence in one
    of their favorite vales. Perhaps the heroes can defeat the monster in
    exchange for the honor of being allowed on a journey to Vadreheim.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>THAAJ</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A desert city-state in the eastern reaches of Roshallan’s power, Thaaj is
  powerful not for its agriculture, but for its proximity to the Smoldering
  Canyon. Thaajan miners labor tirelessly to gather valuable and magical metal
  from the canyon.

<p>
  Thaaj is also hellbent on defeating Roshallan. Its current general, Prince
  Belan, is concocting an elaborate plan to march a great offensive of elephants

  <b>Academic. </b>Thaaj takes great pride in Smoldering Canyon Academy, an
  educational institution that attracts scholars and mages the world over. In
  addition to traditional courses, the school’s proximity to the Smoldering
  Canyon encourages scientists to pursue a vast number of experiments to learn
  more about the nature of magic.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Thaaj is a monarchy. The queen personally
  selects her advisors from successful merchants, scholars, and military
  commanders in her nation. The queen’s eldest daughter becomes the heir, and
  her eldest son grows up to become the commanding general of Thaaj’s army.
  Thaajan generals tend to be very loyal to their sisters, making them dedicated
  protectors of the nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Thaaj extensively mines the Smoldering Canyon,
  extracting tremendously valuable minerals. Precious metals and gems can be
  found in the Smoldering Canyon, along with rare magical metals such as
  avadrium, arcanium, primor, adamantine, and mithril. They also extract
  valuable inks that can be used in the creation of magical tattoos.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Thaaj has a small but mighty military. Their heavy cavalry,
  consisting of elephants, is especially renowned. Thaajan scholars have been
  developing the craft of using magical tattoos to enhance a creature’s
  abilities and have enhanced some elephants - called arcanophants - to be
  devastating war animals.
</p>
<br />
<p>

  and Avadri. Notable among their most prominent gods are Tamat, Judesaril, and
  Rakariel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Most Thaajans are wildly anti-Roshallan. This translates to a
  fierce nationalism and a desire to do anything to help Thaaj improve.

  <b>UNJAARN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Once a nation of nearly twice its current size, Unjaarn has many layers of
  history in its large cities crumbling under their own weight. The young nation
  of Vadan used to be part of Unjaarn, and while Unjaarn maintains its
  traditional customs, Vadan is much more driven by change and new philosophies.
  This leads most Unjaarni to disregard the Vadanians as foolish.
</p>
<br />
<img
  data-filename="Unjaarn"

  style="width: 414px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Swampy and humid year-round, the people of Unjaarn are almost all at least
  competent in boating through bogs and marshes. The wilderness of Unjaarn is a
  tangle of mangroves, hemlock, and black spruce among other tropical and
  subtropical trees, all of which is overgrown with lichens, kudzu, and
  parasitic plants like strangler figs. All manner of dangerous animals and
  strange monsters lurk in the murky waters outside of civilization, but skilled
  rangers can navigate the swamps skillfully to avoid the worst of these
  creatures.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Unjaarn’s largest cities have well-equipped schools of
  philosophy, science, and fine arts. Attendance at such schools is reserved for
  the top three castes. Trades workers commonly apprentice under masters to
  learn their crafts.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Unjaarni Castes. </b>Unjaarn maintains a rigid caste system. An Unjaarni
  will remain in the same caste that their parents were born into, as will their
  children, in perpetuity. Some Unjaarni believe that this system helps foster
  internal peace as nobody has to compete for higher status: their status is
  preordained. Other Unjaarni think that this limits the potential creativity
  and competence from many of the lower castes and the system should change.
  Needless to say, a majority of the Unjaarni that are happy with the system as
  it currently stands are those in the upper castes, although no group holds
  completely monolithic views. Many Unjaarni that are completely unsatisfied
  with the caste system will emigrate to Vadan, which has the same cultural
  history but has much more social mobility.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Brahma. </b>The first and highest caste of Unjaarn are its religious
  leaders. While they do not hold any governmental authority, the other castes
  look to them for moral guidance and their counsel often sways the Nelida.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Nelida. </b>The second caste are the elite among the Lectuadi. There are
  only a few dozen Nelida families in Unjaarn; they are regional and national
  legislators, judges, and generals.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Lectuadi. </b>The third caste is the lowest caste allowed (and in fact
  required) to attend formal schooling. Local legislators and judges come from
  this caste. Lectuadi are also appointed to tactical roles overseeing the
  Duskiran.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Duskiran. </b>The fourth caste is the armed forces. Both local town guards
  and the national infantry are considered Duskiran. Captains and generals are
  from the fourth caste, however.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While many Likishuan and Kirish attempt to emigrate to Vadan for upward social
  mobility, Unjaarn is also in a heated conflict with Vadan. The border between
  the two nations is a violent and contentious place.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Kirish. </b>The trades workers and merchants share the fifth caste.
  Blacksmiths, tanners, weavers, and traders live slightly more comfortable
  lives than the Likishuan, but are still forbidden from pursuing formal
  schooling.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Likishuan. </b>The sixth and lowest caste of Unjaarn is the manual
  laborers, who maintain the nation’s agriculture and infrastructure. Even the
  lowest caste is treated with basic humanoid dignity, as the higher castes
  recognize that it is the Likishuan who keep the nation functional.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Likishuan and Kirish castes have a dialect of speaking that is almost
  incomprehensible to the upper castes. While the words are generally the same
  as the common language, the accent and speech patterns are so thick that the
  Likishuan and Kirish can easily communicate private messages to one another.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>At religious ceremonies, the castes are made to sit in order
  of their caste, with the Likishuan furthest from the altar, the Nelida closest
  to it, and the Brahma performing rituals that involve a sacrificial offering
  of food and drink to the gods.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Unjaarni believe that every pantheon exists, and likely many more that nobody
  is aware of. Each town and household may have specific deities that they feel
  especially drawn to worship as their patrons. The Shibmar Conclave of the
  Archfae - specifically Lob, Tamat, and Khailain - are nationally venerated and
  believed to be some of the most powerful gods out of any pantheon. Most
  Unjaarni believe in reincarnation, though they do not scientifically
  understand Essence.

<p>
  A network of swampy bayous and steamy marshlands, Vadan recently seceded from
  its southern neighbor, Unjaarn. Although they share a culture and belief
  system, the Vadanians differ strongly from the Unjaarni in their approach to
  governance. While Unjaarn is a rigid caste system, Vadan runs on an
  aggressively capitalist government. Many folk from Vadan would prefer to live
  in Unjaarn, and vice versa, but the border between the two nations is a
  dangerous and often violent region.

<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Vadan exports food, spices of many varieties, and
  clay to neighboring nations. They also mine the Great Chasm to their north and
  export gems and rare metals. Vadan is locked in a trade war with Unjaarn,
  trying to lock down trade partnerships with other nations and block Unjaarn
  from doing so.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>The Vadanian military is tremendously patriotic but poorly
  trained. Having recently secured independence from Unjaarn, the Vadanian
  military now struggles to bring discipline and structure to its ranks. In
  skirmishes with Unjaarni, the Vadanians usually win in battles that transpire
  in thick underbrush but lose if the battle takes place on an open lake or
  plain.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Political and Social. </b>Vadan has a very free-market approach to
  governance. Those who seize on risky opportunities might flourish or might end
  up being left out to dry. There is no social safety net other than the
  generosity of neighbors, and many would rather ensure that they get ahead
  instead of spending time offering charity and risking getting dragged down
  themselves. Because of Vadan’s highly stressful and volatile system, some
  Vadanians emigrate to Unjaarn, where the rigid caste system provides
  stability.

  <b>Religious. </b>Vadanians largely share the same religious beliefs as the
  Unjaarni. There are many hundreds of gods, and individual communities may pay
  special homage to specific deities. As in Unjaarn, three specific gods from
  the Shibmar Conclave of the Archfae hold special prominence: Tamat, Khailain,
  and Immort.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Many independent smugglers help transport people south into

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VADAN</b></h3>
<p>
  The capital of Vadan, by the same name, was the third-largest city in Unjaarn
  before the secession. While most of the citizens of the capital strongly
  prefer Vadan’s system of governance to Unjaarn’s, there are clear signs of
  poverty in Vadan’s mucky alleyways, shantytowns, and glamorous fenced-off
  neighborhoods.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The capital is home of Vadan’s only university, which is also where the
  governmental buildings are located. Vadan is run by a parliament of the
  fifteen wealthiest citizens of the country. This is reassessed every
  half-year, which in theory would allow for a quickly rotating door of
  legislators. In practice, a couple dozen wealthy elites spend most of their
  time running their businesses or passing legislation that benefit their
  business or hurt their rivals, ensuring that they remain in the legislative
  shortlist.

<p>
  In a word, Vaenyth is cruel. Its jagged shale hills are full of dangerous

  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>With perhaps the most bizarre governing
  system in Gathandia, Vaenyth chooses their new monarch once every ten years.
  When they do so, each noble family who wishes to make a bid for the monarchy
  sends forth a champion to fight on their behalf. These champions each battle
  to the death in a massive arena riddled with traps and captured monsters. The

  <b>VALSTROM</b>
</h2>
<p>
  In the shadowy Thunderhead Vale to the east of the Cloudpiercer Range, the
  kingdom of Valstrom sprawls along the Thunderhead River. With the
  Cloudpiercers to Valstrom’s west and north, and the Hadla mountains to its
  east, Valstrom catches a tremendous amount of rain and humidity from the Kozia
  Rainforest. Valstrom’s summers are hot and humid, its winters chilly and often
  snowy. Its falls are vibrant with bright leaves, its springs with bright
  flowers.

  style="width: 420px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Valstrom’s charming seasons have drawn many peoples over the generations, and
  in the clearings of the subtropical forests its ancient towns are steeped in
  layers of history. Most towns and all of Valstrom’s cities are heavily
  timber-based, with log buildings and wooden tiles or thatched roofs. A few
  fortified buildings, such as the town watch and the lord or lady’s castle, are
  predominantly classical stone castles.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Generations ago, Shadradoth split away from Valstrom as an independent nation.
  When the king passed away, his chief advisor became king regent, but refused
  to abdicate when the late king’s daughter came of age. The resulting civil war
  tore the kingdom in half, and Princess Shadra, unable to claim the throne from
  Rehan Jehoram, had to make do with her half of the kingdom. The Jehorams
  continue their rule to this day.

  <b>Academic. </b>Valstrom’s larger towns usually have some kind of academy or
  university. Some of these are in a state of disuse, but many still have
  thriving libraries, research facilities, and classes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>A classical feudal society has been
  implemented in Valstrom for all of its recorded history. Mayors report to
  counts and countesses, who report to dukes and duchesses, who report to the
  monarch. The monarch’s eldest child assumes the monarchy after their parent
  passes away or abdicates the throne.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Valstrom has had its share of unrest, but over
  many generations it has proven to be a reliable trade partner. Its neighboring
  land nations include Sozein and Tafunga to the south, and Falth, Nalathesh,
  and Husk to the north. Valstrom maintains a robust trade relationship with
  Shadradoth despite their historical tensions. Merchants competent in mountain
  passes will also trade with Hadla to the east.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Valstrom maintains its classical feudal system in how its
  military functions. Each mayor has a small local army that keeps the peace in
  and around their settlement. Counts and countesses also have small armies, and
  have the political capital to levy the armies of the mayors that live within
  their territories. Dukes and duchesses can likewise levy any army under the
  control of any count in their province, and the monarch can of course levy any
  duke’s or duchess’s forces when the need arises.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Valstromians traditionally worship the Celestial Council,
  seeing its leaders as the gods that bless or curse them in accordance with
  their piety, or lack thereof. Any settlement will have at least a small temple
  with an altar dedicated to these gods, and the larger cities compete with one
  another to have the grandest, most beautiful temple out of any Valstromian
  society.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Most Valstromians are content with their feudal hierarchy, but
  some are discontent with it. Many of the peasantry have their basic needs met:
  food, drink, comfortable shelter, and basic leisure activities. These peasants
  often don’t care whether they get ahead in life or not, so long as their needs
  remain fulfilled. Some of the peasantry, by contrast, think that the feudal
  system is out of date and should have been abolished long ago.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Many counts and dukes also feel tremendous discontent. Having achieved
  success, but knowing that the dukes will always have more power and influence,
  counts and countesses often lose sleep scheming about how they might get ahead
  in the political system. Dukes and duchesses, in turn, often fret about
  maintaining the power they have.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>Valstrom’s traditional feudal structure leaves ample room
  for crime syndicates to operate in the shadows, as details often get lost in
  the chain of command from mayor to monarch and back. Notable syndicates
  include the Twice Strikes, the Hoods, and the Galepiercers (see Shadradoth for
  information on each syndicate).

  the foothills of the Hadla Mountains. Parts of Stormvale have fallen into
  utter disrepair and are almost more forest than city at this point, but much
  of the city - especially that closest to the river - thrives as a bustling
  metropolis.

  <b>VEL</b>
</h2>
<p>
  A tiny but powerful city-state clinging to the craggy beaches of Gathandia’s
  southeast peninsula, Vel is ruled by a kleptocratic oligarchy known as the
  Mages of the Beach. The Mages control every aspect of life in Vel and their
  powerful diviners keep a watchful eye on the city-state, ready to quash
  dissent at a moment’s notice. Common laborers and merchants live in crowded,
  narrow, and steep switchback streets built precariously along the beach’s
  steep cliffs, and the Mages’ enormous towers soar high above the cliffs like
  jagged teeth.

<p>
  On the beach itself, trained cannon crabs ward off any plunderers and a single
  fortified pier allows merchant vessels to trade with Vel.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Vel’s influence is felt far and wide internationally, and the Mages of the
  Beach have a thinly concealed desire to dominate the world, first through the
  soft power of influence and then through the hard power of conquest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>The Mages of the Beach have a large university in one of
  their central towers. They commonly invite well-known scholars to spend time
  teaching in their university’s halls, and while scholars visit Vel, the Mages
  aggressively try to brainwash these scholars to mirror Vel’s philosophical
  talking points when the scholars set forth for other universities.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>The Mages of the Beach hold unquestionable
  control over every aspect of life in Vel. Any administrative position or legal
  office is held by a Mage of the Beach.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>Vel is currently pursuing an international
  strategy of soft influence. They export entertainment goods, games, novels,
  and leisure activities, trying to inculcate Velan culture into every other
  nation on Gathandia.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Highly interested in the city-state of Husk for its location on a point of
  power, Velan scholars are working on developing a way to open a permanent
  teleportation portal between two areas so that they can trade with Husk much
  more readily.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Militant. </b>Under the command of General Vilhelm Cynthar, a skilled
  combat mage, Vel’s military is highly trained and effective. Every Velan
  soldier is capable of basic magic casting of some kind and is trained in
  fighting with unique magical weapons.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>The Mages of the Beach have introduced a unique religion to
  Vel. Many gods are inscribed on illuminated cards, which citizens are
  encouraged to buy and trade. The Mages of the Beach started with pantheons
  that are commonly accepted throughout Gathandia, and released fewer copies of
  certain gods to increase their scarcity. The more god-points you have, the
  more religious you are and the more blessed you will be, the Mages declare.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  They have released several “seasons” of cards and have made up a vast number
  of fictitious pantheons so that they can keep printing more and more cards.
  The more cards that they print, the higher number of god-points a commoner
  will need in order to maintain their good fortune.

  <b>YODVAN</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Long ago, the bravest sailors from Fjordenhaven braved the Ice Seas of the
  north and made landfall on a strange and wondrous island of snow. They
  explored a forest whose plants seemed to be made of a vegetable-metallic
  hybrid and ventured into the fog-choked mountains beyond. There, they found
  Yodvan’s true treasure: a mythically hard and strong material that came to be
  known as adamantine.
</p>
<br />
<img

  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  Several expeditions later, the Fjordenhavians had sent enough people and
  supplies to this island that they were able to establish a permanent outpost.
  It grew into a city, and from there several more towns were established as
  eager miners and explorers ventured into the Glowing Forest and the Mountains
  of Adamant. Eventually, facing political pressure from his youngest sister and
  struggling to manage Fjordenhaven proper and the distant island of Yodvan, the
  king of Fjordenhaven gave the island of Yodvan to his sister as an independent
  nation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The snowblown island of Yodvan experiences days where the sun does not set
  during the summer, and experiences long nights during winter. In the darkest
  days of winter, the sun does not rise at all.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Academic. </b>Aurora’s Hearth, the capital of Yodvan, has a large
  scientific academy that conducts endless experimentation with adamantine and
  the various biotechnical discoveries that explorers find in the Glowing
  Forest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Aristocratic and Political. </b>Like Fjordenhaven, Yodvan practices a
  monarchy of pure primogeniture: the eldest child of each monarch becomes the
  next monarch. Subsequent children (or other family members) are assigned to be
  counts and countesses over Yodvan’s towns.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Mercantile and Trade. </b>To this day, Yodvan remains independent but is
  closely allied with its parent nation: Fjordenhven sends foodstuffs to Yodvan
  in exchange for an influx of glass lights and adamantine. Yodvan can sell its
  commodity goods for enormous returns in virtually any nation that it can
  reach.

  <b>Militant. </b>Yodvan does not have a standing infantry, but has highly
  trained and well equipped town guards. Most town guards have “electric
  torches” fashioned from the glowing glass lights that people harvest from the
  forest. They are also equipped with adamantine shields and spears, making them
  quite tough to beat. Yodvan does maintain a reasonably powerful navy with
  vessels and sailors that are well-equipped for dealing with icy waters.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Religious. </b>Yodvan observes many of the same religious practices that
  are held by their southern neighboring nation, Noord. Most folk worship both
  winter as a harsh but strengthening goddess, and Aurora - the northern lights
  - as a goddess of bounty, beauty, and good fortune. They also pay homage to
  the Fjordenhavian patron god of fire, Aeshir, but he is not as prominent in
  Yodvanian religion as Aurora or Strack, the winter.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Social. </b>Yodvan’s culture is a blend of Fjordenhaven’s and Noord’s.
  Having generally adopted the religious beliefs of Noord, Yodvan has the less
  militant attitude shared by the Fjordenhavians. The folk of Yodvan are
  generally warm and hospitable to strangers, but punish crime very severely.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Underworld. </b>A thriving crime syndicate constantly smuggles new
  inventions from Yodvan out to the rest of the criminal world throughout
  Gathandia. This is dangerous work: if caught, thieves are dumped in frigid
  water and left to the fish. Even so, the lucrative profit is enough to lure
  many into this line of work.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>AURORA'S HEARTH</b></h3>
<p>
  Aurora’s Hearth is the first outpost founded by Fjordenhaven hundreds of years
  ago. It has since developed into a sprawling city that hugs the coastline for
  dozens of miles. The old town, where Fjordenhavian sailors first made
  landfall, is where the monarch’s palace stands tall and proud against the
  cold. The Yodvanian Academy of Sciences is a few miles south of the old town.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Aurora’s Hearth is clean, well-maintained, and well-lit at night, thanks to
  the glowing glass lights harvested from the forest. The city watchguards do an
  excellent job of mitigating violent crime and home burglary, but struggle to
  tamp down on controlled goods being smuggled out of the city’s numerous ports.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>The Glowing Forest. </b>The glowing forest was created from ancient Avadri
  technology, though this has not yet been discovered by Yodvanian researchers.
  Its vegetation grows in strangely intentional patterns: trees might have limbs
  at precise angles, and a bush’s leaves might all be exactly the same size. The
  vegetation seems to be made of an alloy of both plant and metal materials, and
  scientists are still experimenting with the best uses for this material. Glass
  bulbs grow from many trees and bushes in a variety of shapes, and these bulbs
  will often glow with internal light. Scientists have discovered how to control
  when these lights turn on and off, and the bulb’s light will last for several
  years after being plucked.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Other discoveries no doubt lie deep in the Glowing Forest, but strange
  monsters of untold power lurk in the forest’s depths as well. Determined but
  cautious, the Yodvanians have made slow progress in uncovering the secrets
  within the forest’s depths.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>The Mountains of Adamant. </b>Shrouded in thick fog and palpable mystery,
  the Mountains of Adamant loom cold and foreboding along the center of the
  large island. The promise of great wealth in the form of adamantine lures many
  miners and adventurers, but both the terrain and the fauna are vicious in
  these mountains, not to mention the winds that could rip flesh from bone.
  Jagged cliffs, treacherous glaciers, and narrow passes each pose threats to
  explorers. Terrifying creatures that lurk deep in the mountain’s caves often
  leave even stoic heroes babbling with inarticulate fright.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>QUEST IDEAS</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Yodvan holds many valuable materials, notably adamantine and glowing glass.
    The heroes might be recruited by Yodvanian scientists or by patrons from
    another nation to travel deeper into the Glowing Forest or the Mountains of
    Adamant to find more of these materials or to make new discoveries.
  </li>
  <li>
    An eldritch being has awakened in a mineshaft in the Mountains of Adamant,
    and so officials call on the heroes to stop the monster before it can cause
    lasting damage.
  </li>
  <li>
    An incredibly brutal winter has completely buried a town in snow. The heroes
    must oversee efforts to rescue the town, but starving polar bears and hungry
    abominations from the Glowing Forest have other ideas for the town’s trapped
    citizens.
  </li>
  <li>
    The heroes are recruited by a network of magic item smugglers working for
    Husk or Vel. They want the heroes’ help in procuring a new item that
    scientists have created with the plant-metal of the Glowing Forest.
  </li>
</ul>
