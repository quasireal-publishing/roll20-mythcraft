  This ballista is mounted on a low-to-the-ground wagon. It can be saddled to
  horses or other beasts of burden, and any beast that can carry at least two
  unwieldy items can pull the ballista by themself. It is light enough to
  feasibly be dragged by a couple strong humanoids. Portable ballistae cost
  1,500 sc.
