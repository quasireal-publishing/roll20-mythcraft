<p>
  Ancerra is the planet on which MythCraft’s adventures begin. This chapter
  offers detailed information on forty-seven nations that occupy Ancerra’s
  biggest continent, Gathandia. Ancerra has many explorable regions beyond the
  oceans that surround Gathandia. Indeed, Ancerra has five moons, three of which
  have breathable atmospheres and vegetation. You should feel free to make up
  interesting environments for your players to explore, but the information in
  this chapter will give you plenty of specific material to work with if you run
  your games on the continent of Gathandia.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE TEAR</b></h2>
<p>
  Ancerra’s broad history can be divided into four supereons, each transition
  into a new supereon marked by some kind of momentous event. The setting for
  MythCraft’s first adventures is the second supereon.
</p>

  style="width: 512px; float: right"
/>
<p>
  The first supereon was a prolonged time of enormous planetary natural
  disasters and rampaging kaijan.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A series of devastating disasters and valiant efforts from humanoids to put an
  end to the kaijan menace laid the groundwork for civilizations to truly
  prosper, and a remarkable phenomenon in the sky reflects this monumental
  change. For generations, the night sky held nothing other than the moons.
  Murky clouds lay beyond the moons by night and the sun by day. But about eight
  hundred years ago, this changed. Like a tear in a curtain, a great rend opened
  in the sky. By day, this is a stretch of sky where the distant clouds are
  absent, though normal atmospheric clouds might still float through this space.
  By night, those who look to the sky can see stars for the first time in
  recorded history. While the clouds that separate Ancerra’s solar system from
  the Pale still persist, the enormous tear in the sky is filled with the magic
  of twinkling stars, filling the people of Ancerra with wonder and awe.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>INTERNATIONAL GUILDS</b></h2>
<p>
  In addition to the many nations of Gathandia, international guilds are also
  major players on the continent. Note that this section deals specifically with
  guilds that hold an international presence and are not explicitly associated
  with a nation. Falthic crime syndicates, for example, do not have a dedicated
  entry here as they are closely tied to the nation of Falth.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CRIME SYNDICATES</b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ARDENTS</b></h3>
<p>
  Based in Roshallan, the Ardents are a covert order of zealots who believe that
  Roshallan’s aggression and annexation of other nations is unforgivable. The
  Ardents view themselves as the tools of the divine, as just punishment for
  Roshallan’s actions. Ardents believe that they are morally superior to crime
  syndicates - the Ardents act out of a strong desire for justice, while
  criminal entities act out of a drive for profit. Even so, Ardents will
  begrudgingly make alliances with any network, criminal or otherwise, that
  might help weaken Roshallan in some way. The Ardents also implement
  assassination and skullduggery to weaken Roshallan’s imperial grip on its
  provinces.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>HARLAN’S GUILD</b></h3>
<p>
  Harlan’s Guild has many interests and is known best as a magic items smuggling
  operation. By thieving from caravans and robbing stores known to keep magic
  items in stock, Harlan’s Guild then resells these items on the black market.
  When other syndicates in their territory try to get in on magic item fencing,
  Harlan’s Guild takes very unkindly to this and harrasse the up and coming
  syndicate until they back off of the market.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Guild is well known for crafting unique poisons with which they coat their
  weapons. They use these poisons to gain an edge when they must fight, and they
  are not afraid of trading blows when needed. Robbing stores or caravans that
  traffic magic items is usually a dangerous and bloody ordeal, so these poisons
  are integral to giving them an upper hand in their heists.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Harlan’s Guild is a widespread network sprawling across most of Gathandia. Its
  headquarters is in Falth, where Harlan himself governs Breachvale, a large
  city on Nalathesh’s border.
</p>
<br />

        <p>
          Members of Harlan’s Guild readily have access to these three poisons.
          Harlan’s Guild can also access many more poisons; these are simply
          their specialties and are always available to guild members.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ICEGRAVE</b></h3>
<p>
  Icegrave is a relatively small but effective crime syndicate that operates in
  the far north. Its headquarters is in a small, fortified town tucked away in a
  treacherous mountain pass in northern Noord. Icegrave also has major operating
  cells throughout Yodvan and even has a small presence as far south as
  Nalathesh, where Icegrave’s operatives sell their smuggled goods to Falthic
  crime guilds, the Scorpions, and other black market buyers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Icegrave primarily concerns itself with the theft and black market selling of
  the strange materials taken from the Glowing Forest. Chiefly a syndicate of
  smugglers, Icegrave will nonetheless take on other jobs when the opportunity
  and potential rewards are great enough.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MUL’ATOR</b></h3>
<p>
  Originally based in Betaal, the Mul’Ator have since been exiled for their
  bloodthirsty reputation. They were a faction of the Shinus that still dwell in
  Betaal, but have since become their own organization. Nobody knows where they
  are headquartered now - nobody except for Felson Weskh, who has bought their
  loyalty and who pays for them to maintain a headquarters in Gavare even as
  they report to him directly.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Mul’Ator have a reputation for being unparalleled assassins who seem to
  revel in dismembering their victims and leaving their corpses as gruesome
  monuments to death. They operate all across Gathandia, and when a wealthy and
  influential person wants to hire a brutal assassin, they need turn no farther
  than the Mul’Ator.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SCORPIONS</b></h3>
<p>
  Masquerading as a simple merchant caravan, the Scorpions are a dangerous and
  unpredictable crime guild. They operate primarily in Nalathesh, Kandif, and
  Lesmishan, but are known to travel as far east as Kendaria and as far south as
  the Thunderhead Vale.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Scorpions could almost be considered a mercenary group, as they will take
  jobs for high-paying patrons but will also rob and bully other merchant
  caravans. They primarily facilitate international black market trade by
  transporting illicit goods across their vast territory. This is usually a
  lucrative business, but they will turn to their more violent acts - robbing
  other caravans and even raiding towns - when the black market is in a dry
  season.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>UNDERMINERS</b></h3>
<p>
  Based in Bridgemoor but operating along the entire east coast of Gathandia -
  and even as far west as Nalathesh - the Underminers are a crime syndicate with
  strong cult elements. Many members of the Hierophants are also involved with
  the Underminers due to the Underminers’ quasi-religious fascination with the
  Avadri. The Underminers believe that gaining a better understanding of the
  Avadri will allow them to reshape the world, much as the Avadri shaped the
  world ages ago. The Underminers primarily consist of thieves and smugglers
  that amass Avadrium and other magical objects, and of scientists who
  experiment with these materials to discover new uses of them. When possible,
  the Underminers also destabilize local governments or place their own members
  in seats of power so that they can prepare the way for their idea of a greater
  future.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE WEB</b></h3>
<p>
  An expansive crime syndicate that prominently stretches across the western
  half of Gathandia and even has a few operatives east of the Cloudpiercers,
  this secretive syndicate is known simply as the Web. Its members are some of
  the most unobtrusive, trustworthy-looking folk in any given settlement.
  Grandmotherly herbalists, kindly general store owners, and bumbling town
  guards all might be members of the Web. Members can identify one another by
  their decorative doilies, which they keep hidden in plain sight in their
  stores, homes, or with their belongings. The Web’s mission is to destroy the
  Illuminati by exposing and discrediting its members, and they are willing to
  employ any means necessary according to the skill set of their local members.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Web believes that the Illuminati suppresses the freedoms and privacy of
  the people throughout Gathandia, and seek to dispel what they view as a
  corrupt and tyrannical shadow over the land.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MAGICAL GUILDS</b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE CABINET</b></h3>
<p>
  The Cabinet is a secret council of twelve masters of psionic magic. They
  oversee instructors, who in turn train hundreds of psionic latents. The
  Cabinet’s instructors often also serve as neutral advisors to many nations and
  are dispersed across Ancerra, serving as translators, diplomats, and
  long-distance telepathic communicators. A representative from the Cabinet
  serves as a symbol of status and lends legitimacy to a nation’s leader.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When one of the Cabinet’s twelve masters knows that they will soon pass on,
  they choose a protege to take their place. This is generally a well-respected
  member of the Cabinet with a strong record as an instructor or advisor. When
  one of the Cabinet’s twelve masters finally dies, their physical body
  deteriorates, but their Essence lives on in a shared Mind Palace accessible by
  all of the twelve.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE CULTIVATORS</b></h3>
<p>
  Cultivators typically practice divine magic, and if they do not then they
  still ascribe to the higher principles of their gods - especially Tovare, the
  head matron of the Celestial Council. They take vows of poverty, humility, and
  chastity and commonly travel throughout Ancerra to the poorest communities to
  help them develop. Some Cultivators travel to many communities over the course
  of their lives, never settling down, and others (typically the wiser ones)
  focus on one or two key communities and spend their whole lives and
  livelihoods helping those specific communities. Cultivators that settle in
  specific communities often become cherished members of society, while those
  that travel around more can be seen as out of touch.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE FIXERS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Fixers is an institution of psionic casters that boasts thousands of
  members throughout Ancerra. They primarily view themselves as the solutions to
  direct problems like collapsed bridges or roving monsters. They travel their
  regions to collect bounties, defeat monsters that are troubling settlements,
  and telekinetically repair infrastructure.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>HAVEN CONCLAVE</b></h3>
<p>
  The Haven Conclave are guides and sentinels skillful in the natural world.
  Many members of the Haven Conclave are rangers, oracles, and witches, and most
  can use at least a little primal magic.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Haven cloisters offer shelter and solace from the storm. Haven sentinels stand
  on the edges of the more depraved elements of wilderness, defending innocent
  settlements and beasts alike from unnatural threats. Guides often offer their
  services to merchants or adventuring parties struggling to navigate a fearsome
  land.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE HIEROPHANTS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Hierophants are an esoteric divine organization. Prophets of the avadri,
  the Hierophants believe that they can learn to divine the future by
  deciphering the coding written into the universe. The organization is small
  and reclusive, but widespread. If one knows where to look and whom to ask
  after, a clever investigator can usually find a Hierophant alcove.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ILLUMINATI</b></h3>
<p>
  An order of arcane casters who consider themselves more knowledgeable and more
  discerning than any other order, the Illuminati master arcane divining,
  enchanting, and illusory magic. Members of the Illuminati keep their
  affiliation secret and communicate with one another covertly. Members of the
  Illuminati range from prominent scholars to minor nobles to monarchs of entire
  kingdoms. They use their collective wealth, knowledge, and influence to steer
  the geopolitics of Gathandia as they see fit. While they strive to keep the
  whole of Gathandia safe and peaceful, their means are often seen as invasive.
  The largest concentration of Illuminati dwell in Valstrom, and Valstrom’s
  monarch is one of the preeminent members of the organization.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>LIGHTS FROM BELOW</b></h3>
<p>
  Colloquially known as Lebellos or Elbes, the Lights from Below is a small wing
  of psions dedicated to improving Ancerra. The Lights from Below use their
  telekinetic powers to construct bridges and dig wells. Those with psionic
  powers of persuasion will dissuade bandits and monsters from their violent
  actions. Members of the Lights from Below do not seek wealth or fame from the
  outside world, taking internal satisfaction in their work. While traveling,
  full members will nurture young latents. Their headquarters, the Hall of
  Heroes, is a massive hall carved into a mountain face in the Cloudpiercer
  Range. It is filled with statues and frieze sculptures that depict heroes from
  the organization and their famous adventures.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>PATH OF ASCENDANCY</b></h3>
<p>
  The Path of Ascendancy is an infamous school of the occult. Ascendants profess
  that anyone can become a god in their own right if they try hard enough and
  are willing to sacrifice enough; this sacrifice comes with immense physical
  and mental toll. For new initiates in the Path to advance in rank, they must
  bring in additional new initiates.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Ascendants cast their magic by drawing intricate, beautifully complex
  geometric shapes. Many Ascendants get these shapes tattooed on themselves as
  signs of rank, belonging, and power.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Great Ascendant is the leader of the Path. Although once human, he has
  undergone so many permanent transformations that he now looks like an
  archfiend. He has goat legs, huge claws, cat eyes, ram horns, a snake’s tongue
  and fangs, and enormous bat wings. Every inch of once-human flesh has been
  burned and branded so many times that it’s as tough as leather and as red as
  raw meat. His skin is also covered in geometric tattoos that are never quite
  symmetrical.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>REWEAVERS</b></h3>
<p>
  A widespread and decentralized organization of arcane casters specializing in
  alchemy and altering, members of the Reweavers are a welcome sight in any
  struggling town. Capable of quickly repairing and rebuilding basic objects and
  even whole buildings, Reweavers believe that their magical powers should be
  freely shared with those in need. Reweavers are generally content to receive a
  modest income and free room and board for their services, caring not for great
  wealth. While the Reweavers do not have an official home and can be found in
  most nations, they are most active in Anedonia and Doshairiel. They used to
  operate widely in the region that is now Roshallan, but as the empire took
  over many of the Reweavers looked elsewhere. Roshallan’s effective
  infrastructure and its tyrannical rule gave Reweavers both little reason to
  stay, and great reason to leave.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SAVANTS OF THE PALE</b></h3>
<p>
  By focusing on the mystical mists of the Pale, members of this cryptic
  institution learn how to hide and obscure their tracks. They believe that this
  is of fundamental importance, because once they become experts at hiding their
  magical presence, they can steal more powerful abilities from gods and planar
  beings and escape undetected, free to use their newfound powers however they
  please. Casters from this group are notable for wearing deep, hooded cloaks
  and for casting occult magic by singing strange, dissonant choral melodies.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SOOTHSAYERS</b></h3>
<p>
  A monastic collection of hermits, most of whom have oracular abilities, dwell
  in the Cloudpiercer Range in and around Betaal. As their numbers have grown,
  some have migrated and started new monastic communities to the south and west.
  These folk, known as the Soothsayers, have untold powers of divining. They
  typically keep to themselves, living within their own monasteries and only
  traveling into the greater world when they feel that a great prophecy must be
  shared.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Some Soothsayers share prophecies with specific kingdoms or even specific
  people, while others prophesy to a broader audience.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The founder of the Soothsayers, Elindira Stavrelyden, began manifesting
  psionic divining abilities even before magic was widespread. She predicted the
  Tear exactly one year before it happened, down to the very minute.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>STORM CONCLAVE</b></h3>
<p>
  Members of the Storm Conclave are vengeful naturalists trying to burn down
  society and return everyone to hunter-gatherer lifestyles, as this is the way
  that they believe nature intended for humanity to live. They especially target
  international trading groups such as the WGC, or popular routes utilized by
  intercity merchants such as the Golden Road, trying to destabilize the veins
  of modern living and return the world to its days of so-called glory.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SURROGATES</b></h3>
<p>
  A small and ambitious group of arcanists, the Surrogates specialize in
  summoning magic, taking their name from the fact that they conjure forth other
  creatures to act in their place. Primarily operating in Doshairiel and
  Nalathesh, the Surrogates strongly oppose the Unsoiled. The Surrogates profess
  that reanimating a corpse to do manual labor or any other task is
  disrespectful to the memory of the person, and that summoning other creatures
  is not only more humane, but also more effective as one can summon a creature
  suited to the task at hand. The Unsoiled, in turn, argue that any living
  creature should be free to do as it wishes while the dead see to the grunt
  work of society. The two groups often get into verbal - and sometimes physical
  - bouts with one another.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>UNSOILED</b></h3>
<p>
  Some arcanists hold that the greatest stain on humanoid achievement is death.
  None have been able to outsmart it or outrun it. Some powerful psions live on
  as ghostly presences in their mind palaces, and some druids - especially elven
  druids - might live for a thousand or more years before they die, but even
  they cannot guarantee that their bodies will never fade.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Unsoiled find this an abomination. With a contemporary understanding of
  magic, surely a person ought to live forever if they wish to. The Unsoiled are
  expert necromancers who generally use their magical abilities to help their
  communities. They will raid graveyards and animate skeletons to perform manual
  labor around a town, freeing up other folk to relax or pursue other
  activities.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This has been well-received in some communities, but others find the presence
  of the Unsoiled unnatural and repulsive. Many of the Unsoiled also
  aggressively pursue experimentation on humanoid corpses, trying to discern a
  way to extend a body’s livelihood indefinitely.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A majority of Unsoiled are well intentioned and are harmless to the public, if
  a bit creepy. Some, however, become transfixed by their fascination with
  death, and this obsession consumes them. Most famous among these is Mirva the
  Carver. Mirva was a Gavarese halfling with a relatively normal life. She
  practiced some arcane magic, but was more concerned with tending her family,
  including her two sons and her daughter. When a monster razed her town and
  tragically slaughtered her family, she turned to necromancy to revive her
  husband and her three children. Unfortunately, they were only shells of their
  former selves, so Mirva continues to seek enough power and understanding to
  restore their personalities. She wanders the southern Cloudpiercer Range,
  murdering anyone who loses their way and raising more and more corpses into
  her service.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>VIGIL</b></h3>
<p>
  A large, decentralized denomination that worships all Celestials and Avatars -
  especially those that have a militant attitude against evil and corruption,
  members of Vigil or “Vigilants” have sworn to protect the innocent and weak
  from threats that lie beyond. Some branches of Vigil are welcome in
  settlements that fear attacks from monsters. While all branches of Vigil are
  founded on good intentions, there are totalitarian branches of Vigil that do
  more harm than good.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>W.A.N.D.</b></h3>
<p>
  W.A.N.D. (Worldwide Arcanists who Neutralize Danger) is a large and widespread
  organization of mages and arcanists. Their headquarters is officially in
  Constel on the east coast, but W.A.N.D. has regional strongholds across all of
  Gathandia and, according to their leaders, maintain a presence on Ancerra’s
  other continents as well. W.A.N.D.’s arcanists view themselves as
  magic-wielding soldiers, spies, and diplomats whose primary goal is the
  protection of Ancerra from extraplanar threats. Occasionally, if a tyrannical
  regime grows strong enough to threaten the world order, then W.A.N.D. might
  intervene, but they generally reserve their concerns for otherworldly threats.
  W.A.N.D. arcanists specialize in evoking and warding magic, but many arcanists
  choose a third function to focus on as well.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>MERCENARY ORGANIZATIONS</b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>BLACK SOIL</b></h3>
<p>
  A brutal mercenary band that operates in the northwest, Black Soil can
  typically be found in Skavr, Eryndor, and Ruptaea, though they occasionally
  operate in Fjordenhaven as well. This mercenary band is utterly unscrupulous,
  enjoying the more violent jobs with unsettling glee.
</p>
<br />
<p>They burn, loot, and pillage towns with reckless abandon.</p>
<br />
<p>
  Black Soil also has strong cult elements and has been known to perform
  horrifying chants and dances in homage to the dark spirits that live in
  Nachtskog. Indeed, some folk whisper that the evil of Nachtskog inhabits the
  mercenaries of Black Soil, giving them additional strength and menace.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE GENTLEMAN BRIGANDS</b></h3>
<p>
  In the troubled lands of the Thunderhead Vale and the Kosia Rainforest,
  corruption runs rampant in most governmental institutions from the top down to
  local administrations. While many common folk are able to scrape together a
  modestly comfortable life despite this, there are many others who suffer under
  this inequality. The Gentleman Brigands seek to help those who cannot fend for
  themselves under such circumstances. They rob from the wealthy, keeping a cut
  to fund their own crusade and giving the rest of their spoils to those who
  they believe need it the most. They travel throughout the Rainforest and the
  Vale, willing to sell their services to the rare honest noble in exchange for
  better wages for the noble’s subjects. The Brigands are something of a legend
  throughout this region, celebrated by the poor among the society and reviled
  by many of the rich - especially the corrupt. The Gentleman Brigands are
  always led by a person known as the Hood, who passes their title on to their
  successor when they believe it time to lay down their own blade. The current
  Hood is a kleppin with the features of a red-tail fox, and his best friend and
  bodyguard is a grizzled Urkou named Big Butch.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>RESERVES</b></h3>
<p>
  An order of hermetic zealots, the Reserves can be found in small monasteries
  throughout Gathandia. They are self-sufficient communities that maintain their
  own sustenance farms and spin their own clothes from sheep’s wool. Besides
  sustaining themselves, the Reserves train rigorously for the world’s hour of
  need. They believe that one day, ancient threats or new foes will arise and
  threaten the planet’s very existence, and on this day, the Reserves will stand
  ready to protect existence as they know it.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE IRON RIDERS</b></h3>
<p>
  Equestrians skilled at mounted combat and horseback archery, the Iron Riders
  roam the north and west of the Great Chasm. Although it is uncommon, they can
  be seen as far south as Nalathesh and as far east as Derk. They primarily
  operate in Bishal, southern Noord, Kandiff, and Lesmishan. The Iron Riders are
  highly competent in desert environments and have learned how to ride their
  steeds such that they produce little dust, allowing them to sneak up on
  unsuspecting merchants. Following the basic practices of most mercenaries, the
  Iron Riders will leave alone those who pay their shakedown prices and will
  fight on behalf of those who reward them more significantly.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE SEA SERPENTS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Sea Serpents are an armada of pirates who prowl the eastern coast of
  Gathandia, from Vel in the south to Derk in the north. The Sea Serpents
  nominally agree that other vessels under the same flag are off-limits for
  piracy, but in practice, as long as there is no evidence remaining, then
  anything goes. Bloody ocean battles between the Sea Serpents will leave one
  ship sinking and in flames while the other makes off with its loot. When they
  feel that they are facing existential threat, however, the Sea Serpents will
  set aside all of their internal rivalries to take on whatever might threaten
  their way of life.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Sea Serpents are based in a vast oceanic cave on the coast of Muskshir.
  Most Muskshiri do not condone the Sea Serpents, but are not militarily
  powerful enough to oust them. Aside from generalized piracy, a Sea Serpent
  captain and crew will take on virtually any job for well-paying clients.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Individual Sea Serpent captains will have personal flags, and the Sea
  Serpents’ shared flag is a white serpent on an emerald-green banner.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TYPHOON</b></h3>
<p>
  A rowdy armada that prowls the southern seas, Typhoon is a pirate guild that
  will take on any job for wealthy clientele. They escort, plunder, or sink
  merchant vessels as asked and are not above changing sides mid-assignment if
  the price is right. Typhoon ships strictly do not battle one another - a rule
  that is maintained successfully, unlike the Sea Serpents on the east coast.
  Typhoon ships often clash with Roshallan’s navy and with the WGC.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  As is common for seafaring folk, captains affiliated with Typhoon will fly
  both their personal flags and the Typhoon colors: a pale blue vortex on a
  black flag.

<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ADVENTURE ADVISOR</b></h3>
<p>
  Adventure Advisor is a service provided to many adventurers and travelers that
  ranks taverns, inns, marketplaces, smithies, and even chapels according to
  different metrics. Each location that has an adventure advisor review is
  ranked on a scale of one to five shields, coins, and stars. The more shields,
  the safer the location is; the more coins, the greater its expenses; and the
  more stars the greater the overall quality and enjoyment reported by its
  patrons. These rankings are created using specially cultivated arcane
  Signatures and are only visible to people who have purchased an Adventure
  Advisor Assistant, which is a magical whittled owl that reveals these rankings
  on an establishment’s main door.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Adventure Advisor is administered by a handful of mages and arcane casters who
  developed their unique application of the signature cantrip to create such
  rankings.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ARTISANS INTERNATIONAL</b></h3>
<p>
  Artisans International certainly has a legitimate side, but is essentially a
  front for an enormous crime syndicate. This company maintains showrooms,
  exhibits, and auctions of fine art of many varieties. Patrons can easily find
  paintings, fine jewelry, and elegant sculptures at these events and
  storefronts. Artisans International keeps detailed records of all of their
  transactions and has curated an elaborate system of small and large
  organizational operations within the umbrella company. Their international
  status and complicated business practices enable them to easily source,
  acquire, and resell fine art across Gathandia. Their methods of acquiry
  generally include extortion, blackmail, and burglary, and Artisans
  International is careful never to resell a work of art in the same city that
  they acquired it.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE GOLDEN ROAD</b></h3>
<p>
  The Golden Road is not literally a road that connects Kendaria to Anedonia,
  but it may as well be for how effective it is at facilitating international
  trade. Based and administered in Bridgemoor, the Golden Road is a collection
  of affiliated inns, taverns, and marketplaces that facilitate international
  trade. Participating locations offer deals and discounts to traveling
  merchants of any nationality who opt into the business. Such merchants must
  pay an annual dues. The administration of the Golden Road use these funds to
  finance renovation and monetary aid to participating locations that need such
  services. Locations that are members of the Golden Road must maintain a clean
  and safe space, lest they lose membership. The Golden Road has enabled spices,
  raw goods, ideas, and finished products to be disseminated across broad
  swathes of Gathandia.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>HISTORIANS GUILD</b></h3>
<p>
  The Historians Guild is an independent institution that catalogs historical
  artifacts, transcribes and translates recorded histories, and offers
  presentations to educate the public on historical matters. They often work in
  collaboration with the Order of Discerning Prewritten History and with
  Artisans International, both of whom are institutions with overlapping
  interests. The Historians Guild is controversial among people who are already
  deeply in touch with their historical roots because the Guild frequently buys
  or otherwise acquires artifacts of historical significance, removing them from
  their original context and placing them on display in museums. Some members of
  the Guild are also secretly soldiers that protect the world from ancient
  threats, especially those that they awaken in crypts and other archaeological
  sites.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Their role as silent protectors makes members of the Guild feel that they have
  earned the right to hoard ancient artifacts in their treasured museums.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>WEST GATHANDIA TRADING COMPANY</b></h3>
<p>
  The West Gathandia Trading Company, or WGC, is a private corporation that
  builds enormous deep-sea vessels in the shipyards of Pash. The WGC has
  warehouses and administration buildings in virtually every port city along the
  south and east of Gathandia, and has many established trading posts on the
  west coast and in the Inner Sea, as well. The WGC is currently developing
  vessels that should be capable of long-term voyages, allowing their crew to
  explore beyond Gathandia and make contact with the other continents.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Most national governments are not fond of WGC because of the company’s
  aggressive and monopolistic trade practices, but the wealth that they bring to
  the port cities is usually enough to make monarchs and other rulers
  begrudgingly overlook WGC’s less savory practices.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>PERFORMING TROUPES</b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE BUMBLEFUMBLE FESTIVAL</b></h3>
<p>
  Hundreds of nomads travel together to put on the Bumblefumble Festival outside
  different cities across the continent. This festival includes carnival food
  and games, along with performances by the Bumblefumble bards and acrobats.
  Fire eaters, sword jugglers, lion tamers, and other eccentric performers also
  draw crowds in droves. The Bumblefumble Festival has a dark secret, however.
  All of their games are shams designed to separate participants from their
  coins while giving them just enough hope that they might win if they
  participate again. Most folk that work the carnival are also cunning
  pickpockets, lifting just a few coins at a time from their unsuspecting
  victims, but never stealing enough at once to raise undue suspicion. The
  entire carnival, which is the size of a small town when set up, can be broken
  down overnight, allowing the group to quickly clear out when they have
  overstayed their welcome. The Festival is overseen by conjoined twin halflings
  Bumble and Fumble, who are both skilled charlatans and can cast arcane magic,
  respectively specializing in enchanting and illusory functions.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>CIRQUE DU PSION</b></h3>
<p>
  A renowned and spectacular performing group that travels throughout Gathandia,
  especially in its southern nations, Cirque du Psion astounds commoner and
  noble alike.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Highly skilled acrobats enhance their performances with psionic powers,
  enabling them to leap to stunning heights, levitate during their somersaults,
  and telekinetically manipulate their silk ribbons and sparkling hoops to
  achieve beautiful synchronized dances. These performances are highly acclaimed
  and they usually fill a stadium to overflowing for several nights in a row
  when they perform in a highly populated town.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>HARMONIEM</b></h3>
<p>
  Nobles and other folk from high society can often be found attending
  performances put on by Harmoniem. This troupe of thirty talented orchestral
  performers travels Gathandia, performing in prestigious halls, at royal
  palaces, and in other highbrow locations. There are many such orchestras, but
  Harmoniem is by far and away the most famous. Harmoniem consists not only of
  the musical performers, but also skilled caravanners and security who
  accompany the musicians and protect them on the road.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>THE MERRY MINSTRELS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Merry Minstrels are a large, disorganized group of bards and musicians.
  They often travel in groups, but some strike out on their own. Whatever the
  case, the Merry Minstrels bring joy and cheer to the inns and taverns whence
  they perform. They eagerly seek out news songs and stories to add to their
  repertoire, informally spreading news, history, and folklore across Gathandia.
  Joining the Merry Minstrels is not a particularly formal process; one must
  perform a handful of songs or poetic recitations to a minimum of two current
  members of the Merry Minstrels. The most famous Merry Minstrel alive today is
  a six-fingered lute player named Daiquiri Fillingsworth.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>STRAVONITES</b></h3>
<p>
  Taking their name after the Stravon Conclave, the Stravonites are a traveling
  group of performers who put on elaborate plays. They are led by their
  dragonfolk playwright named Shilliam, and they have achieved international
  fame for their lowbrow humor and heartfelt acting. They perform most
  frequently in the Thunderhead Vale but have been known to travel as far west
  as Pash and as far northeast as Forsten.

<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SCHOLARLY ORDERS</b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>ESSENCARY EPISTEMOLOGISTS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Essencary Epistemologists are a group of scholars that travel around
  Gathandia giving lectures and debating with students and other scholars at any
  educational institution where they can find willing participants.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  They can be identified by blue academic regalia with silver embroidered
  threading. By nature, these scholars are most interested in one’s state of
  being, of existing, and contemplating how the process of thinking works. They
  are especially interested in how Essence works, what it is, and how it affects
  a person’s capacity for thought and for experiencing the world. Essencary
  Epistemologists can be found in virtually any major university across
  Gathandia.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>EVIDENTIARY ANALYSTS OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES</b>
</h3>
<p>
  Physicists, chemists, biologists, and other scientists compose the academic
  guild known as the Evidentiary Analysts of Scientific Principles. They pursue
  both mundane and magical experimentation with alacrity, eager to better
  understand the workings of the physical and metaphysical. Some members of this
  scholarly order are themselves mages, while others are simply skilled
  scientists. Recognizable in their deep green academic regalia with red
  embroidery, these analysts can be found at any major university and some
  smaller academic institutions, as well. Scholars within this scientific order
  who specialize in astronomy and metaphysics have strenuous but constructive
  disagreements about the grand design of the multiverse.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)">
  <b>ORDER OF DISCERNING PREWRITTEN HISTORY</b>
</h3>
<p>
  In their light tan regalia with dark red embroidery, members of the Order of
  Discerning Prewritten History can be found both in the lecture hall and at
  archaeological sites. Scholars from this order are particularly interested in
  discovering and preserving anything that they can discern about ancient
  history, from the times before anyone began to record historical events in
  physical form. A mix of academic scholars, painstakingly careful
  archaeologists, and daring tomb raiders, members of the Order network with one
  another to broaden their understanding of ancient events.
</p>
<br />
<p>The Order also corresponds regularly with the Historians Guild.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>TUTORS EXTRAORDINAIRE</b></h3>
<p>
  A nomadic and decentralized order of oracles, the Tutors Extraordinaire travel
  throughout Gathandia. They are highly sought after in any nation’s top
  universities. When a Tutor arrives in a university, they will offer classes
  and hands-on practice of their craft for any amount of time from a single day
  to multiple years. This generally depends on how beneficial a Tutor thinks
  that they can be to a school, but sometimes depends on the Tutor’s own whims
  and desires.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To become a Tutor Extraordinaire and earn the hooded sash that accompanies the
  rank, one must instruct classes for three years, overseen by a different Tutor
  Extraordinaire each year. After being approved by each of the three overseers,
  the teacher will be granted their sash.
</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>WITCH COVENS</b></h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>COVEN OF THE EVERWILDS</b></h3>
<p>
  The Coven of the Everwilds is primarily located in its namesake haunt.
  Throughout the Everwilds, witches of this coven make their homes in villages
  or in the wilderness along with at least two of their fellow witches. Witches
  from this coven actively pursue positive relationships with the Archfae of all
  six Conclaves and are generally respected by fae of all types. Some cells of
  this coven can be found in Gathandia, especially in heavily forested areas
  such as the Kozia Rainforest and the nations around the northern Inner Sea.
  While these witches are seen as eccentric and at times creepy, many folk
  understand that their role as intermediaries between the mortal plane and the
  Archfae Conclaves is very valuable.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>SYMPATHY COVEN</b></h3>
<p>
  The Sympathy Coven is a secretive group of witches that rivals the Illuminati
  in influence and reach. The Sympathy Coven has far fewer witches than the
  Everwilds or Naturalist Covens, but these witches are cunning and powerful.
  Skilled in the art of creating poppets and subtly influencing the people
  represented by these poppets, the Sympathy Coven’s tentacles subtly pull the
  strings of power across Ancerra. Some members of the Sympathy Coven have
  designs on controlling whole empires or continents themselves, but the more
  altruistic members of the coven simply want to use their invisible hand to
  guide Gathandia’s nations away from violent conflict with one another. The
  Sympathy Coven often conducts acts of espionage against the Illuminati.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(23, 67, 69)"><b>COVEN OF NATURALISTS</b></h3>
<p>
  Of the three major witch covens on Gathandia, the Coven of Naturalists is the
  least consequential to world events. The Coven of Naturalists consists of
  witches who admire nature, especially its fauna. Many cells of this coven
  travel the world together, documenting and befriending the various beasts and
  monstrosities that they encounter. Others remain in roughly the same region
  for their whole lives and are beloved by the mundane and magical beasts of the
  region. A young halfling named Katsumash is believed to have the most
  potential to become a legendary Naturalist; although he has only been a member
  of the coven for a year, he has already caught the eye of several senior
  witches in the coven as having a particular way with animals.

        <p>
          Timekeeping in a standardized, international method is uncommon before
          the modern age. Many nations have their own timekeeping customs;
          monarchies, for example, might keep time by numbering the years of a
          ruler’s reign. “The Fifth Year of Queen Astaria III” might be as
          formal as some nations get with their records until standardized
          timekeeping becomes more widespread thanks to scholarly collaboration.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Standardized timekeeping usually references a major event in world
          history. In Ancerra, there are two such events: the Tear and the
          Unity. The Tear marks the transition from Ancerra’s first to second
          Supereon, and the Unity marks its transition from the third Supereon
          to the fourth. Until the time of the Unity, the Tear is used by
          academic scholars as a point of standard reference (BT and PT
          respectively meaning Before the Tear and Post-Tear). After the Unity
          occurs, most scholars adopt it as their timekeeping system, while some
          continue using the Tear as a frame of historical reference. PU and AU
          respectively mean Pre-Unity and After the Unity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Information in this book that references “present day” or “current
          times” refers to the 7th Century Post-Tear, contemporaneous with the
          Cloven Lands campaign module.

<p>
  Millennia before the first humanoid societies came forth on Ancerra, during an
  ancient cosmic war between the Paragon and Corrupted Avadri, Ancerra was a
  stronghold of the Paragon. In order to preserve it from the ravages of war,
  the Avadri shielded it with powerful warding magic and expelled it from the
  material plane into a demiplane that drifted through the Pale. As dangerous as
  the Pale is, Ancerra was nonetheless unaffected as the planet and its solar
