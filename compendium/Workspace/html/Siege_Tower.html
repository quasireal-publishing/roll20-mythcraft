  Siege towers are enormous, wheeled towers usually made of wood and reinforced
  with iron. They provide total cover to creatures within the tower and have
  drawbridges that can be lowered to allow soldiers to run from the top of the
  siege tower directly onto an enemy’s battlements. Beasts that can carry seven
  or more unwieldy items can drag or push a siege tower. A team of beasts that
  can collectively carry that many unwieldy items can also move the tower. Siege
  towers cost 8,000 sc.
