<b>AMULET OF THIRST</b>
</h3>
<p><em>Necklace, Common, Essence 10</em></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  This simple amulet is made from a clear crystal wrapped in gold on a golden
  chain. The amulet has 1 charge and regains its charge at dawn each day. After
  spending 1 hour submerged in a potion, this amulet stores that potion's effect
  as the crystal takes on that potion's color. This expends the amulet's charge.
  The potion then becomes mundane liquid. You may activate the amulet for 1 AP
  and immediately gain the stored effect as if you had consumed the potion
  yourself. After using this feature, the amulet's crystal returns to its
  original clear state and no longer has any potion effects.

<br/>
<p>
  This book is bound in an unidentifiable leather dyed a dark blue and is edged

  book, it disappears after 1 hour. By spending 1 charge, speaking a command
  word, and saying the name of one humanoid within 10 miles of you, the pages
  within the book begin to fill with information about that target humanoid as
  if written by a personal biographer. Anyone who spends 30 minutes reading this
  book gains a +8 to any INT/History check made to learn information about the
  target humanoid, and gains a +6 to AWR/Intuiting, CHA/Intimidating, and
  CHA/Persuading when interacting with the target humanoid for the next 24
  hours. This writing remains in the book for 1 hour, after which it fades and
  becomes blank once again.
