<p>
  This timeline provides context for the nations and guilds across the continent
  of Gathandia. It contains much more in-depth information about Supereons One
  and Two as the first official campaign modules take place in these time

        <h2><b>NOTE ON TIMEKEEPING</b></h2>
        <p>
          Timekeeping in a standardized, international method is uncommon before
          the modern age. Many nations have their own timekeeping customs;
          monarchies, for example, might keep time by numbering the years of a
          ruler’s reign. “The Fifth Year of Queen Astaria III” might be as
          formal as some nations get with their records until standardized
          timekeeping becomes more widespread thanks to scholarly collaboration.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Standardized timekeeping usually references a major event in world
          history. In Ancerra, there are two such events: the Tear and the
          Unity. The Tear marks the transition from Ancerra’s first to second
          Supereon, and the Unity marks its transition from the third Supereon
          to the fourth. Until the time of the Unity, the Tear is used by
          academic scholars as a point of standard reference (BT and PT
          respectively meaning Before the Tear and Post-Tear). After the Unity
          occurs, most scholars adopt it as their timekeeping system, while some
          continue using the Tear as a frame of historical reference. PU and AU
          respectively mean Pre-Unity and After the Unity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Information in this book that references “present day” or “current
          times” refers to the 7th Century Post-Tear, contemporaneous with the
          Cloven Lands campaign module.

          Note that WGC and W.A.N.D. have not yet been formed at the time of the
          Cloven Lands campaign, but are included in the following entries
          nonetheless due to their significant influence over Gathandia after
          their inception.

  <b>THE DEMIPLANAR SHUNT</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Millennia before the first humanoid societies came forth on Ancerra, during an
  ancient cosmic war between the Paragon and Corrupted Avadri, Ancerra was a
  stronghold of the Paragon. In order to preserve it from the ravages of war,
  the Avadri shielded it with powerful warding magic and expelled it from the
  material plane into a demiplane that drifted through the Pale. As dangerous as
  the Pale is, Ancerra was nonetheless unaffected as the planet and its solar
  system drifted through the mists beyond time.
</p>
<h2>
  <b>SUPEREON ONE</b>
</h2>
<p>
  The first Supereon tracks Ancerra from its ancient prehistory to the inception
  of its first nations, the rise and fall of early empires, and finally, the
  Tear.
</p>
<h3><b>FIRST NATION</b></h3>
<p><em>90th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Stone Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The name of the first nation is lost to time, but most archaeologists think
  that its name was Am and have dated its existence to as early as 9,000 years
  before the Tear.
</p>
<h3><b>FOUNDING OF NEVNA</b></h3>
<p><em>47th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Stone Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  A coastal settlement gradually expands into a city-state, and then into a
  small but economically successful nation. This is Nevna, and it is the oldest
  nation that still exists to this day.
</p>
<h3><b>RAMPAGE OF THE COLOSSUS</b></h3>
<p><em>44th-43rd Centuries BT</em></p>
<p><em>Stone Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The Kaijan are titanic monstrosities, ferocious apex predators of ancient
  Ancerra. The largest of all Kaijan, known simply as the Colossus, goes on a
  terrifying rampage that leaves many nations in utter ruin.
</p>
<h3><b>LORD OF THE UNTOLD DEEPS</b></h3>
<p><em>Campaign Module</em></p>
<p><em>41st Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Stone Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  Karnap, the first pirate king, has created a new type of boat that seems more
  seaworthy than the small coastal vessels typical of this time. He is lost at
  sea on his maiden voyage, but other coastal sailors begin seeing his haunting
  visage in their dreams.
</p>
<h3><b>DRAGONSONG</b></h3>
<p><em>Campaign Module</em></p>
<p><em>24th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Stone Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  After the dwarves created the first two Dragons out of the corpse of a Kaijan
  and an artifact of untold power, those dragons sired seven children. These
  nine dragons sing a cosmic song that shapes Ancerra’s reality in fundamental
  ways and creates three new species: Wyrms, Wyverns, and Dragonfolk. Many
  nations view these new species with trepidation, causing the Dragonfolk to
  struggle as they look for their place in the world.
</p>
<h3><b>GILGALON, THE FIRST EMPIRE</b></h3>
<p><em>20th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  After battling one another for some time, two kingdoms form an alliance held
  together by the marriage of two of their most prominent royal leaders. This is
  widely cited as the first political marriage, and whether it was a happy one
  or not, the two kingdoms prospered as the first Ancerran empire: Gilgalon.
</p>
<h3><b>ASSURGAZZAR THE GODKING</b></h3>
<p><em>18th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  A megalomaniacal tyrant named Assurgazzar rises to prominence when he
  overthrows the king of Brazodir, a city-state that no longer exists today, and
  declares himself the godking. He then promptly declares war on his surrounding
  neighbors.
</p>
<h3><b>THE DINOSAUR WARS</b></h3>
<p><em>Campaign Module</em></p>
<p><em>18th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  Assurgazzar and his Immortal Legion wage war on the empire of Gilgalon. Both
  nations implement dinosaur cavalries and many of their bloody battles come to
  an end only when a stray Kaijan takes interest in the carnage.
</p>
<h3><b>WORLD-QUAKE</b></h3>
<p><em>14th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  A series of enormous earthquakes caused by some unknowable reaction in the
  planet’s core tear the world asunder. Ancerra’s single supercontinent splits
  apart into many continents - including Gathandia - that drift into more or
  less their modern locations over the course of the next couple hundred years.
  Mountain ranges, continental borders, island chains, and ocean currents become
  well-defined over this time.
</p>
<h3><b>HAVEN IN THE STORM</b></h3>
<p><em>Campaign Module</em></p>
<p><em>14th-12th Centuries BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  As the tremors of the World-Quake still rock Ancerra, a group of rangers and

  times.
</p>
<h3><b>FJORDENHAVEN AND SKAVR FOUNDED</b></h3>
<p><em>13th Century BT</em></p>

  the Inner Sea form a collection of settlements that eventually grow into
  Anedonia.
</p>
<h3><b>END OF THE KAIJAN AGE</b></h3>
<p><em>12th Century BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>
<p>
  As the ancient supercontinent breaks apart into its configuration that it
  holds throughout the second Supereon, the Kaijan Age gradually comes to an
  end. Kaijan hunt themselves to near-extinction, and legendary heroes finish
  off the rest. The stray Kaijan might still lurk for another few centuries yet,
  but their reign over Ancerra begins its death-knell around this time.
</p>
<h3><b>GOLDEN AGE OF AHTEN</b></h3>
<p><em>11th-7th Centuries BT</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Age Technology</em></p>

</h2>
<p>
  Ancerra’s second Supereon follows world history from the Tear and its
  aftermath through the vast and rich histories of nations that grow, trade, and

</p>

<h3><b>THE MAGIC WAR</b></h3>
<p><em>16th Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Medieval Technology</em></p>

<p>
  As nations grow in economic and military power, they naturally grow restless
  and begin to test their strength. A complex arrangement of alliances embroils

<p>
  Once the Feldrith are no longer a significant threat, many Archfiends,
  Celestials, and Exiles begin to take a direct interest in the avadrium that

<p><em>23rd Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Medieval Technology</em></p>
<p>
  After centuries of experimentation and error, Husk and Vel finally achieve a
  major magical breakthrough: they can draw large teleportation circles in the

<h3><b>HIDDEN WARS</b></h3>
<p><em>24th Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Medieval Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The Illuminati and Web face off more directly than they ever have in the past.

  pawns on a game board. The end of the conflict leaves many nations
  dramatically weaker than they were beforehand.
</p>
<h3><b>GOLDEN AGE OF THE GENTLEMAN BRIGANDS</b></h3>
<p><em>26th-29th Centuries PT</em></p>
<p><em>Medieval Technology</em></p>
<p>
  After the first Hidden War, many international powers are severely weakened,
  especially those in the Thunderhead Vale. This leads to the Gentleman
  Brigands’ golden age under the lead of its young halfling leader named Robyn,
  who idolizes the kleppin Hood of old.

<p><em>Campaign Module</em></p>
<p><em>34th Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Industrial Technology</em></p>
<p>
  Nachtskog, the Black Forest, belches out all manner of monstrosities far more

<p><em>38th Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Modern Technology</em></p>
<p>
  Several belligerent nations seize on recent international unrest and try to
  make power plays, annexing nearby nations too weak to stop them. Eventually,

  first thanks to the advent of modern technology.
</p>
<br />
<h3><b>BIOTECH REVOLUTION</b></h3>
<p><em>40th Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>
<p>
  A faction of humanoids with cybernetic enhancements - especially
  cybernetically enhanced brains - make the claim that they should be the de
  facto governors of their nations. The ensuing revolution is at times bloody
  and at times diplomatic, and ends with a mix of cybernetic and “traditional”
  humanoids leading various nations. Tensions on the matter linger for centuries
  thereafter.
</p>
<h3><b>MOON DISPUTES</b></h3>
<p><em>41st Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>
<p>
  Many modern nations both on Ancerra and on the three habitable moons face
  shortages of basic resources like food and water. The two uninhabitable moons
  might have resources to be mined, but many nations lay claim to these moons
  for a variety of reasons.
</p>

<h3><b>THIRD MAGIC WAR</b></h3>
<p><em>42nd Century PT</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>

<p><em>12th Century PU (43rd Century PT)</em></p>
<p><em>Steampunk Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The Celestials, Fiends, and Exiles battle over Ancerra and its moons. They are
  especially interested in controlling Ancerra due to the planet’s avadrium
  core. The warring is so intense that the Archfae even get involved, first as
  diplomats and then as warriors themselves.

  Drawn by the ancient power contained within Ancerra’s core, creatures and even
  the planes themselves from every corner of the multiverse converge on Ancerra.
  During this time, the Avadri run rampant, and the Celestials, Exiles, and
  Archfiends make an unprecedented alliance to deal with what they view as a
  collectively existential threat in the Avadri.

<h3><b>TUNNEL OF REALITIES</b></h3>
<p><em>1st Century PU (54th Century PT)</em></p>
<p><em>Postmodern Technology</em></p>
<p>
  Harnessing tremendous power beyond the scope of any single god, the Celestials
  and Exiles force the entirety of Ancerra’s multiverse through a series of
  <em>other </em>multiverses. Ancerra’s physical plane was known among the
  highest gods - the six Creator Avatars - as Prime Existence 31 (PE-31). As
  they smashed through subsequent existences, the Celestials and Exiles banished
  the Avadri on PE-33 and finally arrived on PE-36, where Ancerra’s entire
  multiverse and all its planes of existence (except Avadria, of course) became
  embodied galaxies in the much broader PE-36 prime material plane.

<h3><b>THE UNITY</b></h3>
<p><em>Year 0 AU (55th Century PT)</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>
<p>
  All things come together. The immense gravity of the event completely and
  fundamentally restructures Ancerran worldview.
</p>

  <b>SUPEREON FOUR</b>
</h2>
<p>
  After clawing its way out of the ashes of the apocalypse, Ancerra’s future
  looked bright again. The Unity, however, completely destroyed Ancerra’s hope
  of making a full recovery, and the sparse remnant of people that survived
  looked to the stars for one last hope.
</p>
<h3><b>BIG NET VIRUS</b></h3>
<p><em>2nd Century AU (56th Century PT)</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The people of Ancerra follow the leadership of an all-knowing AI. This society
  falls apart when a carefully designed malware program causes the AI to
  collapse, plunging society into a state of anarchy.
</p>
<h3><b>OIT CONTACT</b></h3>
<p><em>4th Century AU (58th Century PT)</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The OIT, an intergalactic trade organization, make contact with the remnant of
  Ancerrans who still live.
</p>
<h3><b>RETURN OF THE AVADRI</b></h3>
<p><em>24th Century AU (78th Century PT)</em></p>
<p><em>Futuristic Technology</em></p>
<p>
  The Avadri develop a multiversally powerful algorithm to travel from PE-33 to
  PE-36. They appear with a vengeance, looking to punish the Celestials and
  Exiles - now notably less powerful - for locking the Avadri away. The result
  is a universe-wide war that leaves nobody untouched.
</p>

<h3><b>ENTROPY AND THE DOOR</b></h3>

<p>
  Eventually, all things come to an end. But in the endless progression of
  creation, the end of one thing is the beginning of another. As the three
  multiverses touched by Ancerra and its gods each inevitably reach their heat
  deaths - peaceful, or perhaps unceremonious depending on one’s view - new
  multiverses are born.
