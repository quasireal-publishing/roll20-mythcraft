One of the most exciting aspects of MythCraft is combat. When your adventuring
party meets a vicious monster or cutthroat bandits, this will likely result in
combat. This chapter will help you consider the various aspects of combat, and
offers a handful of ideas to help you design interesting combat encounters.
DESIGNING A COMBAT When preparing a combat encounter, there are four primary
elements to consider: the heroes, the monsters, the environment, and the
objectives of everyone involved. HEROES Think about the adventurers in your
party. What are they generally good at? Do your martial characters typically
fight in melee or at a distance? In most encounters, you will want to be sure
that your monsters enable your adventurers to fight using their preferred
methods and abilities. In some particularly challenging encounters, though, your
heroes will find that their typical strategies are thwarted. This is especially
true of intelligent villains who can quickly adapt to make the heroes less
effective. MONSTERS Your monsters might be mundane creatures, NPCs with goals
diametrically opposed to the heroes, or fearsome monstrosities of legend. When
designing a combat encounter, it can be helpful to think about the role of
various creatures in battle. These are not technical terms and have no
mechanical bearing, but they can be useful frames of reference to help you
consider how a monster should function in combat. ASSASSIN An assassin has lower
HP and defenses than the average monster of its level, but does more damage and
can increase its damage output through clever tactical positioning. Some
assassins might be hard to hit through other means, like being able to become
Unseen or laying traps to hinder its enemies. BEEFCAKE Beefcakes have much
higher HP or higher defenses than average, but tend to have a significantly
lower damage output. They often have abilities that let them exercise greater
control over the battlefield, such as hindering the mobility of heroes. MINION
Minions are typical monsters of a lower level than most of the others in their
party. They might have slightly lower HP, defenses, and damage output than other
monsters of their same level. Minions are generally easy to dispatch quickly and
adventurers should be able to easily flex their powers to demolish minions.
SUMMONER Summoners have lower HP and attributes than most other monsters of
their level, but have the ability to summon minions. This can create a specific
objective for the adventurers, who must take out the summoner before they are
overwhelmed by its minions. Unless otherwise stated in a specific ability that
summons a creature, assume the following rules apply to a creature's summoned
allies. It takes its turn after the creature in Initiative. It follows the
creature's mental commands. It is friendly to the creature and its allies. It
will fight for the creature until it is killed, the creature is unconscious or
dead, or until the duration ends. SUPPORT Support monsters do not have as much
HP as other monsters of their level and might have lower attributes than others,
but they can significantly bolster the stats of other monsters, making beefcakes
significantly harder to take down or making assassins especially lethal. ENEMY
TACTICS When deciding how your monsters fight, consider their intelligence level
and their instinctive cunning. A pack of wolves will typically only attack one
or two creatures, but are capable of taking down quite large game through
skillful teamwork. Clever bandits will target the party's rogue or ranger first
to remove the party's best capacity to deal damage. An angry bear might simply
go for the creature that looks the most threatening, ignoring the others.
Thinking about your monsters' intelligence will help you determine what kind of
tactics you should use. The monsters with more cunning will not only pick their
targets carefully, but they will also implement their natural surroundings to
better effect. Cautious monsters will think nothing of retreating if they feel
outmaneuvered, and pragmatic villains may appear to retreat only to lure the
heroes into a devastating trap. ENVIRONMENT Rarely will a battle occur on a
perfectly flat stone arena. Nor should it; such a battle would be supremely
boring for tactical positioning. When preparing a battle, think about where the
battle is taking place. A simple forest has trees behind which you might take
cover; some amount of variability in terrain height; roots you might use to trip
enemies; and underbrush might slow you down or conceal you from your enemies.
The more you can conceptualize your environment and the various ways that the
heroes or monsters might use it to their advantage, the more dynamic a combat
can become. If there is not a rule for interacting with a natural object, you
can use TA or TD and the Blinded, Concealed, Cover, Shaken, or Sickened
conditions as you deem appropriate. For example, if you are battling on a beach
and a sailor kicks sand in a hero's eyes, first determine what kind of attack
that would be (DEX vs ANT, for example) then determine its effect (the creature
is Blinded until it spends 1 AP to clear its eyes with water). Such clever
implementations of environmental phenomena will invest your players in using the
battlefield to its fullest possible extent. OBJECTIVES The most common objective
in a fight is to kill or incapacitate the other side, or force them to flee.
While you do not need to pressure yourself to come up with different objectives
for every fight, varying the goals for either the heroes or villains can be a
fun change of pace. Imagine if the heroes or villains have to assassinate or
kidnap a specific target, destroy an object before it can be used, escape
hostile territory, or simply survive until reinforcements to arrive. COMBAT
DIFFICULTY A creature's Monster Level (ML) represents how much of a threat it
poses to a party. A creature of ML 1 would be considered a challenge for two
heroes of Character Level 1. A party of four Character Level 1 heroes could
generally hold their own against two creatures of ML 1, or one creature of ML 2.
To determine whether your encounter is balanced, add up the Character Level of
every hero in your adventuring party, and add up the ML of every creature that
will be directly fighting them. The total ML should be ½ the party's sum
Character Levels. It's fine if the total ML is not exactly ½ the party's sum
Character Levels, but note that this will change the anticipated outcome of a
fight. If the ML in an encounter is lower than ½ a party's Character Levels, the
fight will be easier and will not tax them as greatly. If the total ML is more
than ¾ a party's Character Levels, the fight will be significantly harder and
might kill one or more of the heroes. If the total ML is equal to or greater
than a party's Character Levels, the party is unlikely to survive. If
environmental hazards can equally affect the heroes and the monsters, this will
not adjust encounter difficulty. If environmental hazards might hurt the heroes
but will not affect the monsters (such as a fire elemental in a lava field),
increase the total ML by 25% when calculating encounter difficulty. NOT ALL
FIGHTS ARE FAIR Sometimes, your heroes will be outmatched. If they get into a
situation where they are fighting a monster or group that is significantly more
powerful than them, be sure to communicate this narratively. Perhaps their
arrows are splintering against a beast's fearsome hide, or even after a critical
hit from a zealot, the monstrosity appears completely unfazed. Make sure that
your players know that retreat is an option, and sometimes it is better to cut
your losses and live to fight another day. RUNNING COMBAT Running combat can be
daunting, as it has a lot of moving parts and is at times difficult to keep
track of. When combat begins, write down everyone's Initiative from highest to
lowest so that you can see sequentially who will One of the most exciting

combat can be daunting, as it has a lot of moving parts and is at times
difficult to keep track of. When combat begins, write down everyone's Initiative
from highest to lowest so that you can see sequentially who will be going next.
This should generally be public knowledge for your players, so that they can
begin preparing their turns in advance to help speed up gameplay. If the
battlefield includes environmental phenomena (such as a rockslide) or
complicated enemy movements (such as respawning hordes), you can write these
into the Initiative order so that you remember to do them every round. Most
people find mental addition to be easier and faster than mental subtraction, so
you might want to use this to your advantage when running monsters. Because you
are tracking a lot of different monsters' health at once, you might just add up
the damage that a monster has taken. Tell your players that it is Bloodied when
the sum of all the damage it has sustained equals or exceeds ½ its maximum HP,
and that it has died when the sum of the damage equals or exceeds its maximum
HP. When tracking conditions (such as Dazed or Sickened), you might use colored
beads that you put on a creature's stat block or next to their name in
Initiative. If you use minis, you can twist pipe cleaners into small loops that
are color coded to symbolize various conditions. Whatever methods you use,
having a handful of physical and clearly visible props will help you keep track
of all of the variables in combat. be going next. This should generally be
