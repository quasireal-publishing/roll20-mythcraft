Beasts that can carry seven or more\n  unwieldy items can drag a trebuchet if it is mounted on wheels. A team of\n  beasts that can collectively carry that many unwieldy items can also move the\n  trebuchet. Automatic trebuchets cost 20,000 sc.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p><b>Range: </b>2,300 ft; can clear 100 ft elevation</p>\n<p><b>Ammunition: </b>Ball (3 AP)</p>\n<p><b>Reload: </b>1 AP</p>\n<p><b>AOE: </b>20 ft radius</p>\n<p><b>Heft: </b>20</p>\n<p><b>Speed: </b>20 ft</p>\n<p><b>HP: </b>90</p>\n<p><b>AR:</b> 12</p>\n<p><b>REF:</b> 7</p>\n<p><b>FORT:</b> 14</p>\n<p><b>Resist:</b> Blunt 3</p>\n<p><b>Immune:</b> Psychic</p>\n<p><b>Vulnerable: </b>Fire 1</p>\n<p><b>DR:</b> 6/Fire</p>\n<p><b>DT:</b> 9</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  A creature within 5 ft of the Trebuchet can spend 2 AP to make a siege weapon\n  attack vs the FORT of each target in the radius. This attack suffers a -2\n  penalty against Medium or smaller targets. <b>Hit: </b>6d10 blunt and the\n  target falls Prone. <b>Miss: </b>½ damage and the target does not fall Prone.\n  If the ball did not impact a surface (such as targeting a flying creature), it\n  does not use its AOE radius and does no damage on a miss.\n</p>"
